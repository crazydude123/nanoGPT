109.5.
  (a) Provisions of the articles described in paragraph (3) of subdivision (g) of Section 202 and subdivisions (a) and (b) of Section 204 may be made dependent upon facts ascertainable outside the articles, if the manner in which those facts shall operate upon those provisions is clearly and expressly set forth in the articles.

(4) If the amendment or revision of the referenced agreement would result in a change of any of the principal terms of an agreement of merger, the amendment or revision of the referenced agreement is required to be approved in the same manner as required by Section 1104 for a change in the principal terms of an agreement of merger.

110.
  (a) Upon receipt of any instrument by the Secretary of State for filing pursuant to this division, if it conforms to law, it shall be filed by, and in the office of, the Secretary of State and the date of filing endorsed thereon. Except for instruments filed pursuant to Section 1502, the date of filing shall be the date the instrument is received by the Secretary of State unless the instrument provides that it is to be withheld from filing until a future date, other than instruments filed pursuant to Section 119, or, unless in the judgment of the Secretary of State, the filing is intended to be coordinated with the filing of some other corporate document which cannot be filed. The Secretary of State shall file a document as of any requested future date not more than 90 days after its receipt, including a Saturday, Sunday, or legal 				 holiday, if the document is received in the Secretary of State’s office at least one business day prior to the requested date of filing. An instrument does not fail to conform to law because it is not accompanied by the full filing fee if the unpaid portion of the fee does not exceed the limits established by the policy of the Secretary of State for extending credit in these cases.
(b) If the Secretary of State determines that an instrument submitted for filing or otherwise submitted does not conform to law and returns it to the person submitting it, the instrument may be resubmitted accompanied by a written opinion of the member of the State Bar of California submitting the instrument, or representing the person submitting it, to the effect that the specific provision of the instrument objected to by the Secretary of State does conform to law and stating the points and authorities upon which the opinion is based. The Secretary of State shall 				 rely, with respect to any disputed point of law (other than the application of Sections 119, 201, 2101, and 2106), upon that written opinion in determining whether the instrument conforms to law. The date of filing in that case shall be the date the instrument is received on resubmission.
(c) Any instrument filed with respect to a corporation, other than original articles or instruments filed pursuant to Section 119, may provide that it is to become effective not more than 90 days subsequent to its filing date. In case such a delayed effective date is specified, the instrument may be prevented from becoming effective by a certificate stating that by appropriate corporate action it has been revoked and is null and void, executed in the same manner as the original instrument and filed before the specified effective date. In the case of a merger agreement, the certificate revoking the earlier filing need only be executed on behalf of one of the 				 constituent corporations. If no revocation certificate is filed, the instrument becomes effective on the date specified.
(d) Any instrument submitted to the Secretary of State for filing by a domestic corporation or a foreign corporation that is qualified to transact business in California under Section 2105 shall include the entity name and number as they exist on the Secretary of State’s records.
(Amended by Stats. 2022, Ch. 217, Sec. 1. (SB 218) Effective January 1, 2023.)
110.5.
  The Secretary of State may cancel the filing of articles of a domestic corporation, including articles effecting a conversion, or the filing of a statement and designation by a foreign corporation if a check or other remittance accepted in payment of the filing fee or franchise tax is not paid upon presentation. Within 90 days of receiving written notification that the item presented for payment has not been honored for payment, the Secretary of State shall give written notice of the applicability of this section and the cancellation date, which shall be not less than 20 days from the date of mailing the written notice as certified by the Secretary of State, to the agent for service of process or to the person submitting the 						instrument. Thereafter, if the amount has not been paid by cashier’s check or equivalent before the date of cancellation as stated in the written notice of cancellation, the cancellation shall thereupon be effective.
(Amended by Stats. 2022, Ch. 617, Sec. 4. (SB 1202) Effective January 1, 2023.)

CHAPTER 3. Directors and Management [300 - 318]  ( Chapter 3 added by Stats. 1975, Ch. 682. )

300.
  (a) Subject to the provisions of this division and any limitations in the articles relating to action required to be approved by the shareholders (Section 153) or by the outstanding shares (Section 152), or by a less than majority vote of a class or series of preferred shares (Section 402.5), the business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed and all corporate powers shall be exercised by or under the direction of the board. The board may delegate the management of the day-to-day operation of the business of the corporation to a management company or other person provided that the business and affairs of the corporation shall 				 be managed and all corporate powers shall be exercised under the ultimate direction of the board.
(b) Notwithstanding subdivision (a) or any other provision of this division, but subject to subdivision (c), no shareholders’ agreement, which relates to any phase of the affairs of a close corporation, including but not limited to management of its business, division of its profits or distribution of its assets on liquidation, shall be invalid as between the parties thereto on the ground that it so relates to the conduct of the affairs of the corporation as to interfere with the discretion of the board or that it is an attempt to treat the corporation as if it were a partnership or to arrange their relationships in a manner that would be appropriate only between partners. A transferee of shares covered by such an agreement which is filed with the secretary of the corporation for inspection by any prospective purchaser of shares, who has actual 				 knowledge thereof or notice thereof by a notation on the certificate pursuant to Section 418, is bound by its provisions and is a party thereto for the purposes of subdivision (d). Original issuance of shares by the corporation to a new shareholder who does not become a party to the agreement terminates the agreement, except that if the agreement so provides it shall continue to the extent it is enforceable apart from this subdivision. The agreement may not be modified, extended or revoked without the consent of such a transferee, subject to any provision of the agreement permitting modification, extension or revocation by less than unanimous agreement of the parties. A transferor of shares covered by such an agreement ceases to be a party thereto upon ceasing to be a shareholder of the corporation unless the transferor is a party thereto other than as a shareholder. An agreement made pursuant to this subdivision shall terminate when the corporation ceases to be a close corporation, except that if the 				 agreement so provides it shall continue to the extent it is enforceable apart from this subdivision. This subdivision does not apply to an agreement authorized by subdivision (a) of Section 706.
(c) No agreement entered into pursuant to subdivision (b) may alter or waive any of the provisions of Sections 158, 417, 418, 500, 501, and 1111, subdivision (e) of Section 1201, Sections 2009, 2010, and 2011, or of Chapters 15 (commencing with Section 1500), 16 (commencing with Section 1600), 18 (commencing with Section 1800), and 22 (commencing with Section 2200). All other provisions of this division may be altered or waived as between the parties thereto in a shareholders’ agreement, except the required filing of any document with the Secretary of State.
(d) An agreement of the type referred to in subdivision (b) shall, to the extent and so long as the discretion or powers of the board 				 in its management of corporate affairs is controlled by such agreement, impose upon each shareholder who is a party thereto liability for managerial acts performed or omitted by such person pursuant thereto that is otherwise imposed by this division upon directors, and the directors shall be relieved to that extent from such liability.
(e) The failure of a close corporation to observe corporate formalities relating to meetings of directors or shareholders in connection with the management of its affairs, pursuant to an agreement authorized by subdivision (b), shall not be considered a factor tending to establish that the shareholders have personal liability for corporate obligations.
(Amended by Stats. 1983, Ch. 1223, Sec. 3.)
301.
  (a)  Except as provided in Section 301.5, at each annual meeting of shareholders, directors shall be elected to hold office until the next annual meeting. However, to effectuate a voting shift (Section 194.7) the articles may provide that directors hold office for a shorter term. The articles may provide for the election of one or more directors by the holders of the shares of any class or series voting as a class or series.
(b) Each director, including a director elected to fill a vacancy, shall hold office until the expiration of the term for which elected and until a 				 successor has been elected and qualified.
(Amended by Stats. 1989, Ch. 876, Sec. 1.)

  (a) A listed corporation may, by amendment of its articles or bylaws, adopt provisions to divide the board of directors into two or three classes to serve for terms of two or three years respectively, or to eliminate cumulative voting, or both. After the issuance of shares, a corporation that is not a listed corporation may, by amendment of its articles or bylaws, adopt provisions to be effective when the corporation becomes a listed corporation to divide the board of directors into two or three classes to serve for terms of two or three years respectively, or to eliminate cumulative voting, or both. An article or bylaw amendment providing for division of the board of directors into classes, or any change in the number of classes, or the 						elimination of cumulative voting may only be adopted by the approval of the board and the outstanding shares (Section 152) voting as a single class, notwithstanding Section 903.
(b) If the board of directors is divided into two classes pursuant to subdivision (a), the authorized number of directors shall be no less than six and one-half of the directors or as close an approximation as possible shall be elected at each annual meeting of shareholders. If the board of directors is divided into three classes, the authorized number of directors shall be no less than nine and one-third of the directors or as close an approximation as possible shall be elected at each annual meeting of shareholders. Directors of a listed corporation may be elected by classes at a meeting of shareholders at which an amendment to the articles or bylaws 						described in subdivision (a) is approved, but the extended terms for directors are contingent on that approval, and in the case of an amendment to the articles, the filing of any necessary amendment to the articles pursuant to Section 905 or 910.
(c) If directors for more than one class are to be elected by the shareholders at any one meeting of shareholders and the election is by cumulative voting pursuant to Section 708, votes may be cumulated only for directors to be elected within each class.
(d) For purposes of this section, a “listed corporation” means a corporation with outstanding shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the NYSE American, the NASDAQ Global Market, or the NASDAQ Capital Market.
(e) Subject to 						subdivision (h), if a listed corporation having a board of directors divided into classes pursuant to subdivision (a) ceases to be a listed corporation for any reason, unless the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the corporation provide for the elimination of classes of directors at an earlier date or dates, the board of directors of the corporation shall cease to be divided into classes as to each class of directors on the date of the expiration of the term of the directors in that class and the term of each director serving at the time the corporation ceases to be a listed corporation (and the term of each director elected to fill a vacancy resulting from the death, resignation, or removal of any of those directors) shall continue until its expiration as if the corporation had not ceased to be a listed corporation.
(f) Subject to 						subdivision (h), if a listed corporation having a provision in its articles or bylaws eliminating cumulative voting pursuant to subdivision (a) or permitting noncumulative voting in the election of directors pursuant to that subdivision, or both, ceases to be a listed corporation for any reason, the shareholders shall be entitled to cumulate their votes pursuant to Section 708 at any election of directors occurring while the corporation is not a listed corporation notwithstanding that provision in its articles of incorporation or bylaws.
(g) Subject to subdivision (i), if a corporation that is not a listed corporation adopts amendments to its articles of incorporation or bylaws to divide its board of directors into classes or to eliminate cumulative voting, or both, pursuant to subdivision (a) and then becomes a listed corporation, unless the 						articles of incorporation or bylaws provide for those provisions to become effective at some other time and, in cases where classes of directors are provided for, identify the directors who, or the directorships that, are to be in each class or the method by which those directors or directorships are to be identified, the provisions shall become effective for the next election of directors after the corporation becomes a listed corporation at which all directors are to be elected.
(h) If a corporation ceases to be a listed corporation on or after the record date for a meeting of shareholders and before the conclusion of the meeting, including the conclusion of the meeting after an adjournment or postponement that does not require or result in the setting of a new record date, then, solely for purposes of subdivisions (e) and (f), the 						corporation shall not be deemed to have ceased to be a listed corporation until the conclusion of the meeting of shareholders.
(i) If a corporation becomes a listed corporation on or after the record date for a meeting of shareholders and before the conclusion of the meeting, including the conclusion of the meeting after an adjournment or postponement that does not require or result in the setting of a new record date, then, solely for purposes of subdivision (g), the corporation shall not be deemed to have become a listed corporation until the conclusion of the meeting of shareholders.
(j) If an article amendment referred to in subdivision (a) is adopted by a listed corporation, the certificate of amendment shall include a statement of the facts showing that the corporation is a 						listed corporation within the meaning of subdivision (d). If an article or bylaw amendment referred to in subdivision (a) is adopted by a corporation which is not a listed corporation, the provision, as adopted, shall include the following statement or the substantial equivalent: “This provision shall become effective only when the corporation becomes a listed corporation within the meaning of Section 301.5 of the Corporations Code.”
(Amended by Stats. 2022, Ch. 617, Sec. 9. (SB 1202) Effective January 1, 2023.)
301.7.
  (a) A listed corporation engaged in business limited to the operation and maintenance of a recreation venture having golf and tennis facilities and ancillary dining and beverage services may, by amendment of its articles or bylaws, adopt provisions allowing division of its board of directors into two classes, with one-half of the directors or as close an approximation as possible to be elected at each 				 annual meeting of shareholders, provided that the corporation’s bylaws or articles limit each holder of the securities to no more than five shares and require some of those holders to occupy dwellings immediately contiguous to the real property of the corporation. An article or bylaw amendment providing for division of the board of directors into classes may only be adopted by the approval of the board and the outstanding shares (Section 152) voting as a single class, notwithstanding Section 903. Directors of a listed corporation that meet these conditions may be elected by classes at a meeting of shareholders at which an amendment to the articles or bylaws described in this paragraph is approved, but the extended terms for directors are contingent on that approval, and in the case of an amendment to the articles, the filing of any necessary amendment to the articles pursuant to Section 905 or 910.
(b) For purposes of this section, a “listed 				 corporation” means a corporation described in subdivision (d) of Section 301.5.
(c) If an article amendment referred to in subdivision (a) is adopted by a listed corporation, the certificate of amendment shall include a statement of the facts showing that the corporation is a listed corporation within the meaning of subdivision (b).
(Amended by Stats. 2009, Ch. 131, Sec. 2. (AB 991) Effective January 1, 2010.)
301.9.
  Notwithstanding Section 301, a mutual water company organized under this division may elect directors to serve staggered four-year terms if authorized in the corporation’s articles of incorporation or bylaws. Upon the initial election of directors to staggered terms, the elected directors shall determine by lot who among them shall serve initial two-year terms and who among them shall serve four-year terms. Prior to any election in which the terms of elected directors shall be determined 				 by lot, the mutual water company shall notify its shareholders that the terms of the directors elected shall be determined among those directors by lot.
(Added by Stats. 2011, Ch. 89, Sec. 1. (SB 918) Effective January 1, 2012.)
302.
  The board may declare vacant the office of a director who has been declared of unsound mind by an order of court or convicted of a felony.
(Repealed and added by Stats. 1975, Ch. 682.)
303.
  (a) Any or all of the directors may be removed without cause if the removal is approved by the outstanding shares (Section 152), subject to the following:
(1)  Except for a corporation to which paragraph (3) is applicable, no director may be removed (unless the entire board is removed) when the votes cast against removal, or not consenting in writing to the removal, would be sufficient to elect the director if voted cumulatively at an election at which the same total number of votes were cast (or, if the action is taken by written consent, all shares entitled to vote were 				 voted) and the entire number of directors authorized at the time of the director’s most recent election were then being elected.
(2) When by the provisions of the articles the holders of the shares of any class or series, voting as a class or series, are entitled to elect one or more directors, any director so elected may be removed only by the applicable vote of the holders of the shares of that class or series.
(3) A director of a corporation whose board of directors is classified pursuant to Section 301.5 may not be removed if the votes cast against removal of the director, or not consenting in writing to the removal, would be sufficient to elect the director if voted cumulatively (without regard to whether shares may otherwise be voted cumulatively) at an election at which the same total number of votes were cast (or, if the action is taken by written consent, all shares 				 entitled to vote were voted) and either the number of directors elected at the most recent annual meeting of shareholders, or if greater, the number of directors for whom removal is being sought, were then being elected.
(b) Any reduction of the authorized number of directors or amendment reducing the number of classes of directors does not remove any director prior to the expiration of the director’s term of office.
(c) Except as provided in this section and Sections 302 and 304, a director may not be removed prior to the expiration of the director’s term of office.
(Amended by Stats. 1989, Ch. 876, Sec. 3.)
304.
  The superior court of the proper county may, at the suit of shareholders holding at least 10 percent of the number of outstanding shares of any class, remove from office any director in case of fraudulent or dishonest acts or gross abuse of authority or discretion with reference to the corporation and may bar from reelection any director so removed for a period prescribed by the court. The corporation shall be made a party to such action.
(Repealed and added by Stats. 1975, Ch. 682.)
305.
  (a) Unless otherwise provided in the articles or bylaws and except for a vacancy created by the removal of a director, vacancies on the board may be filled by approval of the board (Section 151) or, if the number of directors then in office is less than a quorum, by (1) the unanimous written consent of the directors then in office, (2) the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office at a meeting held pursuant to notice or waivers of notice complying with Section 307 or (3) a sole remaining director. Unless the articles or a bylaw adopted by the shareholders provide that the board may fill vacancies occurring in the board by reason of the removal of directors, such vacancies may be filled only by 						approval of the shareholders (Section 153).
(b) The shareholders may elect a director at any time to fill any vacancy not filled by the directors. Any such election by written consent other than to fill a vacancy created by removal, which requires the unanimous consent of all shares entitled to vote for the election of directors, requires the consent of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote.
(c) If, after the filling of any vacancy by the directors, the directors then in office who have been elected by the shareholders shall constitute less than a majority of the directors then in office, then both of the following shall be applicable:
(1) Any holder or holders of an aggregate of 5 percent or more of the 						total number of shares at the time outstanding having the right to vote for those directors may call a special meeting of shareholders, or
(2) The superior court of the proper county shall, upon application of such shareholder or shareholders, summarily order a special meeting of shareholders, to be held to elect the entire board. The term of office of any director shall terminate upon that election of a successor.
The hearing on any application filed pursuant to this subdivision shall be held on not less than 10 business days notice to the corporation. If the corporation intends to oppose the application, it shall file with the court a notice of opposition not later than five business days prior to the date set for the hearing. The application and any notice of opposition shall be supported by 						appropriate affidavits and the court’s determination shall be made on the basis of the papers in the record; but, for good cause shown, the court may receive and consider at the hearing additional evidence, oral or documentary, and additional points and authorities. The hearing shall take precedence over all other matters not of a similar nature pending on the date set for the hearing.
(d) Any director may resign effective upon giving written notice to the chairperson of the board, the president, the secretary or the board of directors of the corporation, unless the notice specifies a later time for the effectiveness of such resignation. If the resignation is effective at a future time, a successor may be elected to take office when the resignation becomes effective.
(Amended by Stats. 2015, Ch. 98, Sec. 3. (SB 351) Effective January 1, 2016.)
306.
  If (a) a corporation has not issued shares and all the directors resign, die, or become incompetent, or (b) a corporation’s initial directors have not been named in the articles, and all the incorporators resign, die, or become incompetent prior to the election of the initial directors, the superior court of any county may appoint directors of the corporation upon application by any party in interest.
(Amended by Stats. 2000, Ch. 485, Sec. 6. Effective January 1, 2001.)
307.
  (a) Unless otherwise provided in the articles or, subject to paragraph (5) of subdivision (a) of Section 204, in the bylaws, all of the following apply:
(1) Meetings of the board may be called by the chairperson of the board or the president or any vice president or the secretary or any two directors.
(2) Regular meetings of the board may be held without notice if the time and place of the meetings are fixed by the bylaws or the board. Special meetings of the board shall be held upon four days’ notice by mail or 48 hours’ notice delivered personally or by telephone, including a voice messaging system or by electronic transmission 						by the corporation (Section 20). The articles or bylaws may not dispense with notice of a special meeting. A notice, or waiver of notice, need not specify the purpose of any regular or special meeting of the board.
(3) Notice of a meeting need not be given to a director who provides a waiver of notice or a consent to holding the meeting or an approval of the minutes thereof in writing, whether before or after the meeting, or who attends the meeting without protesting, prior thereto or at its commencement, the lack of notice to that director. These waivers, consents and approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting.
(4) A majority of the directors present, whether or not a quorum is present, may adjourn any meeting to another time and 						place. If the meeting is adjourned for more than 24 hours, notice of an adjournment to another time or place shall be given prior to the time of the adjourned meeting to the directors who were not present at the time of the adjournment.
(5) Meetings of the board may be held at a place within or without the state that has been designated in the notice of the meeting or, if not stated in the notice or there is no notice, designated in the bylaws or by resolution of the board.
(6) Members of the board may participate in a meeting through use of conference telephone, electronic video screen communication, or electronic transmission by and to the corporation (Sections 20 and 21). Participation in a meeting through use of conference telephone or electronic video screen communication 						pursuant to this subdivision constitutes presence in person at that meeting as long as all members participating in the meeting are able to hear one another. Participation in a meeting through electronic transmission by and to the corporation (other than conference telephone and electronic video screen communication), pursuant to this subdivision constitutes presence in person at that meeting if both of the following apply:
(A) Each member participating in the meeting can communicate with all of the other members concurrently.
(B) Each member is provided the means of participating in all matters before the board, including, without limitation, the capacity to propose, or to interpose an objection to, a specific action to be taken by the corporation.
(7) A majority of the authorized number of directors constitutes a quorum of the board for the transaction of business. The articles or bylaws may not provide that a quorum shall be less than one-third the authorized number of directors or less than two, whichever is larger, unless the authorized number of directors is one, in which case one director constitutes a quorum.
(8) An act or decision done or made by a majority of the directors present at a meeting duly held at which a quorum is present is the act of the board, subject to the provisions of Section 310 and subdivision (e) of Section 317. The articles or bylaws may not provide that a lesser vote than a majority of the directors present at a meeting is the act of the board. A meeting at which a quorum is initially present 						may continue to transact business notwithstanding the withdrawal of directors, if any action taken is approved by at least a majority of the required quorum for that meeting.
(b) An action required or permitted to be taken by the board may be taken without a meeting, if all members of the board shall individually or collectively consent in writing to that action and if the number of members of the board serving at the time constitutes a quorum. The written consent or consents shall be filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the board. For purposes of this subdivision only, “all members of the board” shall include an “interested director” as described in subdivision (a) of Section 310 or a “common director” as described in subdivision (b) of Section 310 who abstains in writing from providing consent, where the disclosures required 						by Section 310 have been made to the noninterested or noncommon directors, as applicable, prior to their execution of the written consent or consents, the specified disclosures are conspicuously included in the written consent or consents executed by the noninterested or noncommon directors, and the noninterested or noncommon directors, as applicable, approve the action by a vote that is sufficient without counting the votes of the interested or common directors. If written consent is provided by the directors in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence and the disclosures made regarding the action that is the subject of the consent do not comply with the requirements of Section 310, the action that is the subject of the consent shall be deemed approved, but in any suit brought to challenge the action, the party asserting the validity of the action shall have the burden of proof in 						establishing that the action was just and reasonable to the corporation at the time it was approved.
(c) This section applies also to committees of the board and incorporators and action by those committees and incorporators, mutatis mutandis.
(Amended by Stats. 2015, Ch. 98, Sec. 4. (SB 351) Effective January 1, 2016.)
308.
  (a) If a corporation has an even number of directors who are equally divided and cannot agree as to the management of its affairs, so that its business can no longer be conducted to advantage or so that there is danger that its property and business will be impaired or lost, the superior court of the proper county may, notwithstanding any provisions of the articles or bylaws and whether or not an action is pending for an involuntary winding up or dissolution of the corporation, appoint a provisional director pursuant to this section. Action 				 for such appointment may be brought by any director or by the holders of not less than 331/3 percent of the voting power.
(b) If the shareholders of a corporation are deadlocked so that they cannot elect the directors to be elected at an annual meeting of shareholders, the superior court of the proper county may, notwithstanding any provisions of the articles or bylaws, upon petition of a shareholder or shareholders holding 50 percent of the voting power, appoint a provisional director or directors pursuant to this section or order such other equitable relief as the court deems appropriate.
(c) A provisional director shall be an impartial person, who is neither a shareholder nor a creditor of the corporation, nor related by consanguinity or affinity within the third degree according 				 to the common law to any of the other directors of the corporation or to any judge of the court by which such provisional director is appointed. A provisional director shall have all the rights and powers of a director until the deadlock in the board or among shareholders is broken or until such provisional director is removed by order of the court or by approval of the outstanding shares (Section 152). Such person shall be entitled to such compensation as shall be fixed by the court unless otherwise agreed with the corporation.
(d) This section does not apply to corporations subject to the Public Utilities Act (Part 1 (commencing with Section 201) of Division 1 of the Public Utilities Code).
(Amended by Stats. 1995, Ch. 154, Sec. 3. Effective January 1, 1996.)
309.
  (a) A director shall perform the duties of a director, including duties as a member of any committee of the board upon which the director may serve, in good faith, in a manner such director believes to be in the best interests of the corporation and its shareholders and with such care, including reasonable inquiry, as an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances.
(b) In performing the duties of a director, a director shall be entitled to rely on information, opinions, reports or statements, including 				 financial statements and other financial data, in each case prepared or presented by any of the following:
(1) One or more officers or employees of the corporation whom the director believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented.
(2) Counsel, independent accountants or other persons as to matters which the director believes to be within such person’s professional or expert competence.
(3) A committee of the board upon which the director does not serve, as to matters within its designated authority, which committee the director believes to merit confidence,

so long as, in any such case, the director acts in good 				 faith, after reasonable inquiry when the need therefor is indicated by the circumstances and without knowledge that would cause such reliance to be unwarranted.
(c) A person who performs the duties of a director in accordance with subdivisions (a) and (b) shall have no liability based upon any alleged failure to discharge the person’s obligations as a director. In addition, the liability of a director for monetary damages may be eliminated or limited in a corporation’s articles to the extent provided in paragraph (10) of subdivision (a) of Section 204.
(Amended by Stats. 1987, Ch. 1203, Sec. 2. Effective September 27, 1987.)
310.
  (a) No contract or other transaction between a corporation and one or more of its directors, or between a corporation and any corporation, firm or association in which one or more of its directors has a material financial interest, is either void or voidable because such director or directors or such other corporation, firm or association are parties or because such director or directors are present at the meeting of the board or a committee thereof which authorizes, approves or ratifies the contract or transaction, if
(1) The material facts as to 				 the transaction and as to such director’s interest are fully disclosed or known to the shareholders and such contract or transaction is approved by the shareholders (Section 153) in good faith, with the shares owned by the interested director or directors not being entitled to vote thereon, or
(2) The material facts as to the transaction and as to such director’s interest are fully disclosed or known to the board or committee, and the board or committee authorizes, approves or ratifies the contract or transaction in good faith by a vote sufficient without counting the vote of the interested director or directors and the contract or transaction is just and reasonable as to the corporation at the time it is authorized, approved or ratified, or
(3) As to contracts or transactions not approved as 				 provided in paragraph (1) or (2) of this subdivision, the person asserting the validity of the contract or transaction sustains the burden of proving that the contract or transaction was just and reasonable as to the corporation at the time it was authorized, approved or ratified.
A mere common directorship does not constitute a material financial interest within the meaning of this subdivision. A director is not interested within the meaning of this subdivision in a resolution fixing the compensation of another director as a director, officer or employee of the corporation, notwithstanding the fact that the first director is also receiving compensation from the corporation.
(b) No contract or other transaction between a corporation and any corporation or association of which one or more of its directors are directors is either void or voidable because such director or directors are 				 present at the meeting of the board or a committee thereof which authorizes, approves or ratifies the contract or transaction, if
(1) The material facts as to the transaction and as to such director’s other directorship are fully disclosed or known to the board or committee, and the board or committee authorizes, approves or ratifies the contract or transaction in good faith by a vote sufficient without counting the vote of the common director or directors or the contract or transaction is approved by the shareholders (Section 153) in good faith, or
(2) As to contracts or transactions not approved as provided in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, the contract or transaction is just and reasonable as to the corporation at the time it is authorized, approved or ratified.
This subdivision does not apply to contracts or transactions covered 				 by subdivision (a).
(c) Interested or common directors may be counted in determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting of the board or a committee thereof which authorizes, approves or ratifies a contract or transaction.
(Amended by Stats. 1976, Ch. 641.)
311.
  The board may, by resolution adopted by a majority of the authorized number of directors, designate one or more committees, each consisting of two or more directors, to serve at the pleasure of the board. The board may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent member at any meeting of the committee. The appointment of members or alternate members of a committee requires the vote of a majority of the authorized number of directors. Any such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the board or in the bylaws, shall have all the authority of the board, except with respect to:
(a) The approval of any action for which this division also requires shareholders’ approval (Section 153) or approval of the outstanding shares (Section 152).
(b) The filling of vacancies on the board or in any committee.
(c) The fixing of compensation of the directors for serving on the board or on any committee.
(d) The amendment or repeal of bylaws or the adoption of new bylaws.
(e) The amendment or repeal of any resolution of the board which by its express terms is not so amendable or repealable.

(g) The appointment of other committees of the board or the members thereof.
(Amended by Stats. 1983, Ch. 1223, Sec. 4.)
312.
  (a) A corporation shall have (1) a chairperson of the board, who may be given the title of chair of the board, chairperson of the board, chairperson, or a president or both, (2) a secretary, (3) a chief financial officer, and (4) such other officers with such titles and duties as shall be stated in the bylaws or determined by the board and as may be necessary to enable it to sign instruments and share certificates. The president, or if there is no president the chairperson of the board, is the general manager and chief executive officer of the corporation, unless otherwise provided in the articles or bylaws. Any number of offices may be held by the same person unless the articles or bylaws provide otherwise.
(b) Except as otherwise provided by the articles or bylaws, officers shall be chosen by the board and serve at the pleasure of the board, subject to the rights, if any, of an officer under any contract of employment. Any officer may resign at any time upon written notice to the corporation without prejudice to the rights, if any, of the corporation under any contract to which the officer is a party.
(Amended by Stats. 2022, Ch. 617, Sec. 10. (SB 1202) Effective January 1, 2023.)
313.
  Subject to the provisions of subdivision (a) of Section 208, any note, mortgage, evidence of indebtedness, contract, share certificate, initial transaction statement or written statement, conveyance, or other instrument in writing, and any assignment or endorsement thereof, executed or entered into between any corporation and any other person, when signed by the chairperson of the board, the president or any vice president and the secretary, any assistant secretary, the chief financial officer or any assistant treasurer of such corporation, is not invalidated as to the corporation by any lack of authority of the signing officers in the absence of actual knowledge on the part of the other person that the signing officers had no 						authority to execute the same.
(Amended by Stats. 2015, Ch. 98, Sec. 6. (SB 351) Effective January 1, 2016.)
314.
  The original or a copy in writing or in any other form capable of being converted into clearly legible tangible form of the bylaws or of the minutes of any incorporators’, shareholders’, directors’, committee or other meeting or of any resolution adopted by the board or a committee thereof, or shareholders, certified to be a true copy by a person purporting to be the secretary or an assistant secretary of the corporation, is prima facie evidence of the adoption of such bylaws or resolution or of the due holding of such meeting and of the matters stated 				 therein.
(Amended by Stats. 2004, Ch. 254, Sec. 7. Effective January 1, 2005.)
315.
  (a) A corporation shall not make any loan of money or property to, or guarantee the obligation of, any director or officer of the corporation or of its parent, unless the transaction, or an employee benefit plan authorizing the loans or guaranties after disclosure of the right under such a plan to include officers or directors, is approved by a majority of the shareholders entitled to act thereon.
(b) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), if the corporation has outstanding shares held of record by 100 or more persons (determined as provided in Section 605) on the date of 				 approval by the board, and has a bylaw approved by the outstanding shares (Section 152) authorizing the board alone to approve such a loan or guaranty to an officer, whether or not a director, or an employee benefit plan authorizing such a loan or guaranty to an officer, such a loan or guaranty or employee benefit plan may be approved by the board alone by a vote sufficient without counting the vote of any interested director or directors if the board determines that such a loan or guaranty or plan may reasonably be expected to benefit the corporation.
(c) A corporation shall not make any loan of money or property to, or guarantee the obligation of, any person upon the security of shares of the corporation or of its parent if the corporation’s recourse in the event of default is limited to the security for the loan or guaranty, unless the loan or guaranty is adequately secured without considering these shares, or the loan or guaranty is 				 approved by a majority of the shareholders entitled to act thereon.
(d) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), a corporation may advance money to a director or officer of the corporation or of its parent for any expenses reasonably anticipated to be incurred in the performance of the duties of the director or officer, provided that in the absence of the advance the director or officer would be entitled to be reimbursed for the expenses by the corporation, its parent, or any subsidiary.
(e) The provisions of subdivision (a) do not apply to the payment of premiums in whole or in part by a corporation on a life insurance policy on the life of a director or officer so long as repayment to the corporation of the amount paid by it is secured by the proceeds of the policy and its cash surrender value.
(f) This section does not 				 apply to any of the following:

(2) Any depository institution, as defined in Section 202 of the Depository Institutions Management Interlocks Act (12 U.S.C. Sec. 3201).

(g) For the purposes of subdivisions (a) and (c), “approval by a majority of the shareholders entitled to act” means either (1) written consent of a majority of the outstanding 				 shares without counting as outstanding or as consenting any shares owned by any officer or director eligible to participate in the plan or transaction that is subject to this approval, (2) the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present and voting at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is otherwise present, without counting for purposes of the vote as either present or voting any shares owned by any officer or director eligible to participate in the plan or transaction that is subject to the approval, or (3) the unanimous vote or written consent of the shareholders. In the case of a corporation which has more than one class or series of shares outstanding, the “shareholders entitled to act” within the meaning of this section includes only holders of those classes or series entitled under the articles to vote on all matters before the shareholders or to vote on the subject matter of this section, and includes a requirement for separate class or series voting, or for more or less than one vote per 				 share, only to the extent required by the articles.
(Amended by Stats. 1984, Ch. 812, Sec. 1.)

(3) The making of any loan or guaranty contrary to Section 315.
(b) A director who is present at a meeting of the board, or any committee thereof, at which action specified in subdivision (a) is taken and who abstains from voting shall be considered to have approved the action.
(c) Suit may be brought in the name of the corporation 				 to enforce the liability (1) under paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) against any or all directors liable by the persons entitled to sue under subdivision (b) of Section 506, (2) under paragraph (2) or (3) of subdivision (a) against any or all directors liable by any one or more creditors of the corporation whose debts or claims arose prior to the time of any of the corporate actions specified in paragraph (2) or (3) of subdivision (a) and who have not consented to the corporate action, whether or not they have reduced their claims to judgment, or (3) under paragraph (3) of subdivision (a) against any or all directors liable by any one or more holders of shares outstanding at the time of any corporate action specified in paragraph (3) of subdivision (a) who have not consented to the corporate action, without regard to the provisions of Section 800.

  (a) For the purposes of this section, “agent” means any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or other agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or was a director, officer, employee or agent of a foreign or domestic corporation which was a predecessor corporation of the corporation or of another enterprise at the request of the predecessor corporation; 				 “proceeding” means any threatened, pending or completed action or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative; and “expenses” includes without limitation attorneys’ fees and any expenses of establishing a right to indemnification under subdivision (d) or paragraph (4) of subdivision (e).
(b) A corporation shall have power to indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any proceeding (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor) by reason of the fact that the person is or was an agent of the corporation, against expenses, judgments, fines, settlements, and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with the proceeding if that person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the corporation and, in the case of a criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to 				 believe the conduct of the person was unlawful. The termination of any proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which the person reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the corporation or that the person had reasonable cause to believe that the person’s conduct was unlawful.
(c) A corporation shall have power to indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending, or completed action by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that the person is or was an agent of the corporation, against expenses actually and reasonably incurred by that person in connection with the defense or settlement of the action if the person acted in good faith, in a manner the person 				 believed to be in the best interests of the corporation and its shareholders.
No indemnification shall be made under this subdivision for any of the following:
(1) In respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which the person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation in the performance of that person’s duty to the corporation and its shareholders, unless and only to the extent that the court in which the proceeding is or was pending shall determine upon application that, in view of all the circumstances of the case, the person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for expenses and then only to the extent that the court shall determine.
(2) Of amounts paid in settling or otherwise disposing of a pending action without court approval.
(3) Of expenses 				 incurred in defending a pending action which is settled or otherwise disposed of without court approval.
(d) To the extent that an agent of a corporation has been successful on the merits in defense of any proceeding referred to in subdivision (b) or (c) or in defense of any claim, issue, or matter therein, the agent shall be indemnified against expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the agent in connection therewith.
(e) Except as provided in subdivision (d), any indemnification under this section shall be made by the corporation only if authorized in the specific case, upon a determination that indemnification of the agent is proper in the circumstances because the agent has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in subdivision (b) or (c), by any of the following:
(1) A majority vote of a quorum 				 consisting of directors who are not parties to such proceeding.
(2) If such a quorum of directors is not obtainable, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion.
(3) Approval of the shareholders (Section 153), with the shares owned by the person to be indemnified not being entitled to vote thereon.
(4) The court in which the proceeding is or was pending upon application made by the corporation or the agent or the attorney or other person rendering services in connection with the defense, whether or not the application by the agent, attorney or other person is opposed by the corporation.
(f) Expenses incurred in defending any proceeding may be advanced by the corporation prior to the final disposition of the proceeding upon receipt of an 				 undertaking by or on behalf of the agent to repay that amount if it shall be determined ultimately that the agent is not entitled to be indemnified as authorized in this section. The provisions of subdivision (a) of Section 315 do not apply to advances made pursuant to this subdivision.
(g) The indemnification authorized by this section shall not be deemed exclusive of any additional rights to indemnification for breach of duty to the corporation and its shareholders while acting in the capacity of a director or officer of the corporation to the extent the additional rights to indemnification are authorized in an article provision adopted pursuant to paragraph (11) of subdivision (a) of Section 204. The indemnification provided by this section for acts, omissions, or transactions while acting in the capacity of, or while serving as, a director or officer of the corporation but not involving breach of duty to the corporation and its shareholders 				 shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise, to the extent the additional rights to indemnification are authorized in the articles of the corporation. An article provision authorizing indemnification “in excess of that otherwise permitted by Section 317” or “to the fullest extent permissible under California law” or the substantial equivalent thereof shall be construed to be both a provision for additional indemnification for breach of duty to the corporation and its shareholders as referred to in, and with the limitations required by, paragraph (11) of subdivision (a) of Section 204 and a provision for additional indemnification as referred to in the second sentence of this subdivision. The rights to indemnity hereunder shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee, or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, 				 executors, and administrators of the person. Nothing contained in this section shall affect any right to indemnification to which persons other than the directors and officers may be entitled by contract or otherwise.
(h) No indemnification or advance shall be made under this section, except as provided in subdivision (d) or paragraph (4) of subdivision (e), in any circumstance where it appears:
(1) That it would be inconsistent with a provision of the articles, bylaws, a resolution of the shareholders, or an agreement in effect at the time of the accrual of the alleged cause of action asserted in the proceeding in which the expenses were incurred or other amounts were paid, which prohibits or otherwise limits indemnification.
(2) That it would be inconsistent with any condition expressly imposed by a court in 				 approving a settlement.
(i) A corporation shall have power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any agent of the corporation against any liability asserted against or incurred by the agent in that capacity or arising out of the agent’s status as such whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify the agent against that liability under this section. The fact that a corporation owns all or a portion of the shares of the company issuing a policy of insurance shall not render this subdivision inapplicable if either of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) if the articles authorize indemnification in excess of that authorized in this section and the insurance provided by this subdivision is limited as indemnification is required to be limited by paragraph (11) of subdivision (a) of Section 204; or (2) (A) the company issuing the insurance policy is organized, licensed, and operated in a manner that complies with 				 the insurance laws and regulations applicable to its jurisdiction of organization, (B) the company issuing the policy provides procedures for processing claims that do not permit that company to be subject to the direct control of the corporation that purchased that policy, and (C) the policy issued provides for some manner of risk sharing between the issuer and purchaser of the policy, on one hand, and some unaffiliated person or persons, on the other, such as by providing for more than one unaffiliated owner of the company issuing the policy or by providing that a portion of the coverage furnished will be obtained from some unaffiliated insurer or reinsurer.
(j) This section does not apply to any proceeding against any trustee, investment manager, or other fiduciary of an employee benefit plan in that person’s capacity as such, even though the person may also be an agent as defined in subdivision (a) of the employer corporation. A corporation 				 shall have power to indemnify such a trustee, investment manager, or other fiduciary to the extent permitted by subdivision (f) of Section 207.
(Amended by Stats. 1995, Ch. 154, Sec. 4. Effective January 1, 1996.)
318.
  (a) The Secretary of State shall develop and maintain a registry of distinguished women and minorities who are available to serve on corporate boards of directors. As used in this section, “minority” means an ethnic person of color including American Indians, Asians (including, but not limited to, Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, Pacific Islanders, Samoans, and Southeast Asians), Blacks, Filipinos, and 				 Hispanics.
(b) For each woman or minority who participates in the registry, the Secretary of State shall maintain information on his or her educational, professional, community service, and corporate governance background. That information may include, but is not limited to:
(1) Paid or volunteer employment.
(2) Service in elected public office or on public boards or commissions.
(3) Directorships, officerships, and trusteeships of business and nonprofit entities, including committee experience.
(4) Professional, academic, or community awards or honors.
(5) Publications.
(6) Government relations experience.
(7) Experience with corporate constituents.
(8) Any other areas of special expertise.
(c) In addition to the information subdivision (b) requires, each woman or minority who participates in the registry may disclose any number of personal attributes that may contribute to board diversity. Those attributes may include, but are not limited to, gender, physical disability, race, or ethnic origin.
(d) In addition to the information subdivision (b) requires, each woman or minority who participates in the registry may indicate characteristics of corporations for which he or she would consider, or is especially interested in, serving as a director. These characteristics may include, but are not limited to, 				 company size, industry, geographic location, board meeting frequency, director time commitments, director compensation, director insurance or indemnification, or social policy concerns.
(e) Any woman or minority may nominate himself or herself to the registry by filing with the Secretary of State the information required by subdivision (b) on a form the secretary prescribes. Any registrant may attach a copy of his or her resume and up to two letters of recommendation to his or her registration form. Each registrant’s registration form, together with any attached resume or letters of recommendation, shall constitute his or her registry transcript.
(f) The Secretary of State shall make appropriate rules requiring registrants to renew or update their filings with the registry, as necessary to ensure continued accuracy of registry information.
(g) The Secretary of State shall assign each registrant a file number, then enter the information described in subdivisions (b), (c), and (d) into a data base, using the registrant’s file number to identify him or her. The registry data base shall not disclose any registrant’s name or street address, but may list the city, county, or ZIP Code of his or her business or residence address. The secretary shall make data base information available to those persons described in subdivisions (i) and (j). The secretary may provide that access either by permitting direct data base searches or by performing data base searches on written request.
(h) The Secretary of State may also make information contained in the registry data base available to any person or entity qualified to transact business in California that regularly engages in the business of providing data base access or search 				 services; provided, that data base access will not be construed to entitle the user to access to any registrant’s transcript.
(i) The Secretary of State shall make information contained in a reasonable number of registrants’ transcripts available to any corporation or its representative. A “representative,” for purposes of this subdivision, may be an attorney, an accountant, or a retained executive recruiter. A “retained executive recruiter,” for purposes of this subdivision, is an individual or business entity engaged in the executive search business that is regularly retained to locate qualified candidates for appointment or election as corporate directors or executive officers.
(j) The Secretary of State may also grant access to a reasonable number of registrants’ transcripts to any other person who demonstrates to the secretary’s satisfaction that the person does both of the 				 following:
(1) Seeks access to the registry in connection with an actual search for a corporate director.
(2) Intends to use any information obtained from the registry only for the purpose of finding qualified candidates for an open position on a corporate board of directors.
(k) The Secretary of State may employ reasonable means to verify that any party seeking access to registry transcript information is one of those specified in subdivision (i) or (j). To that end, the secretary may require a representative to identify its principal, but may not disclose that principal’s identity to any other person.
(l) Upon written request specifying the registrant’s file number, the Secretary of State shall provide any party entitled to access to registry 				 transcripts with a copy of any registrant’s transcript. The secretary may by rule or regulation specify other reasonable means by which persons entitled thereto may order copies of registrants’ transcripts.
(m) Notwithstanding any other law, a person shall not be entitled to access to information the registry contains, except as this section specifically provides.
(n) The Secretary of State shall charge fees for registering with the registry, obtaining access to the registry data base, and obtaining copies of registrants’ transcripts. The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Senate Commission on Corporate Governance, Shareholder Rights, and Securities Transactions, shall fix those fees by regulation. Fees shall be fixed so that the aggregate amount of all fees collected shall be sufficient to cover the total cost of administering the registry program. Registration fees 				 shall be fixed so as to encourage qualified women and minorities to participate. Fees shall be deposited into the Secretary of State’s Business Fee Fund.
(o) The Secretary of State may make any rule, regulation, guideline, or agreement the secretary deems necessary to carry out the purposes and provisions of this section.
(p) The Secretary of State may cooperate with the Commission on the Status of Women and Girls, the California Council to Promote Business Ownership by Women, the Senate Commission on Corporate Governance, Shareholder Rights, and Securities Transactions, women’s organizations, minority organizations, business and professional organizations, and any other individual or entity the secretary deems appropriate, for any of the following purposes:
(1) Promoting corporate use of the registry.
(2) Locating qualified women and minorities and encouraging them to participate in the registry.
(3) Educating interested parties on the purpose and most effective use of the registry.
The secretary may also prepare and distribute publications designed to promote informed use of the registry.
(q) The Secretary of State may seek registrants’ consent to be listed in a published directory of women and minorities eligible to serve as corporate directors, which will contain a summary of each listed registrant’s qualifications. The secretary may periodically publish, or cause to be published, such a directory. Only those registrants who so consent in writing may be included in the directory. The printed directory shall be provided to any person upon payment of a fee, which the 				 Secretary of State will determine by regulation, in consultation with the Senate Commission on Corporate Governance, Shareholder Rights, and Securities Transactions.
(r) The Secretary of State shall implement this section no later than January 1, 1995.
(s) At least once in each three-year period during which the registry is available for corporate use, the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Senate Commission on Corporate Governance, Shareholder Rights, and Securities Transactions, shall report to the Legislature on the extent to which the registry has helped women and minorities progress toward achieving parity in corporate board appointments or elections.
(t) The Secretary of State shall notify each University of California campus and each California State University campus of the opportunity to maintain 				 the registry created pursuant to this section. If more than one campus of the university or state university expresses interest in maintaining the registry, the Secretary of State shall select a campus based on a competitive selection process. If a campus is selected, the Secretary of State shall transfer the information contained in the registry, free of cost, to that campus. Any University of California or California State University campus selected to maintain the registry shall do so in a manner consistent with this section. Funds deposited in the Secretary of State’s Business Fees Fund pursuant to this section shall be transferred to the university selected to maintain the registry, and shall be used to administer the registry program. The Secretary of State shall maintain the registry until a University of California or California State University campus agrees to do so.

CHAPTER 4. Shares and Share Certificates [400 - 423]  ( Chapter 4 added by Stats. 1975, Ch. 682. )

400.
  (a) A corporation may issue one or more classes or series of shares or both, with full, limited or no voting rights and with such other rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions as are stated or authorized in its articles. No denial or limitation of voting rights shall be effective unless at the time one or more classes or series of outstanding shares or debt securities, singly or in the aggregate, are entitled to full voting rights; and no denial or limitation of dividend or liquidation rights shall be effective unless at the time one or more classes or series of outstanding shares, singly or in the aggregate, are entitled to unlimited dividend 				 and liquidation rights.
(b) All shares of any one class shall have the same voting, conversion and redemption rights and other rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, unless the class is divided into series. If a class is divided into series, all the shares of any one series shall have the same voting, conversion and redemption rights and other rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions.
(Amended by Stats. 1976, Ch. 641.)
401.
  (a) Before any corporation issues any shares of any class or series of which the rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions, or any of them, or the number of shares constituting any series or the designation of the series, are not set forth in its articles but are fixed in a resolution adopted by the board pursuant to authority given by its articles, an officers’ certificate shall be executed and filed, setting forth: (1) a copy of the resolution; (2) the number of shares of the class or series; and (3) that none of the shares of the 				 class or series has been issued.
(b) After any certificate of determination has been filed, but before the corporation issues any shares of the class or series covered thereby, the board may alter or revoke any right, preference, privilege, or restriction fixed or determined by the resolution set forth therein by the adoption of another resolution appropriate for that purpose and the execution and filing of an officers’ certificate setting forth a copy of the resolution, and stating that none of the shares of the class or the series affected has been issued.
(c) After any certificate of determination has been filed, the board may, if authorized in the articles pursuant to subdivision (e) of Section 202, increase or decrease the number of shares constituting any series, by the adoption of another resolution appropriate for that purpose and the execution and filing of an officers’ 				 certificate setting forth a copy of the resolution, the number of shares of the series then outstanding and the increase or decrease in the number of shares constituting the series. If any certificate of determination has been incorporated in restated articles filed pursuant to Section 910, the action authorized by this subdivision may, notwithstanding Section 902, be accomplished by an amendment of the articles approved by the board alone.
(d) After shares of a class or series have been issued, the provisions of the resolution set forth in a certificate of determination may be amended only by the adoption and approval of an amendment in accordance with Section 902, 903, or 904 and the filing of a certificate of amendment in accordance with Sections 905 and 908. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a certificate to increase or decrease the number of shares of a series also may be filed as permitted by subdivision (c).
(e) A provision in a certificate of determination being amended pursuant to subdivision (b), (c), or (d) shall be identified in the amendment in accordance with subdivision (a) of Section 907.
(f) If a certificate is filed pursuant to subdivision (c) to decrease the number of shares of a series to zero, the certificate of determination whereby the series was established is thereupon no longer in force and the series is no longer an authorized series of the corporation.
(g) If the rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions of the class or series contain a supermajority vote provision, as defined in subdivision (b) of Section 710, subject to Section 710, the officers’ certificate shall also state that the provision has been approved by the shareholders in accordance with subdivision (c) of Section 				 710.
(Amended by Stats. 1993, Ch. 128, Sec. 4. Effective January 1, 1994.)
402.
  (a) A corporation may provide in its articles for one or more classes or series of shares which are redeemable, in whole or in part, (1) at the option of the corporation or (2) to the extent and upon the happening of one or more specified events, and not otherwise except as herein provided. A corporation may provide in its articles for one or more classes or series of preferred shares which are redeemable, in whole or in part, (1) as specified above, (2) at the option of the holder, or (3) upon the vote of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of the class or series to be redeemed. An open-end investment company registered under the United States Investment Company Act of 1940 may, if its articles so 						provide, issue shares which are redeemable at the option of the holder at a price approximately equal to the shares’ proportionate interest in the net assets of the corporation and a shareholder may compel redemption of such shares in accordance with their terms.
(b) Any such redemption shall be effected at such price or prices, within such time and upon such terms and conditions as are stated in the articles. When the articles permit partial redemption of a class or series of shares, the articles shall prescribe the method of selecting the shares to be redeemed, which may be pro rata, by lot, at the discretion of, or in a manner approved by, the board or upon such other terms as are specified in the articles.
(c) No redeemable common shares, other than (1) shares issued by an open-end 						investment company registered under the United States Investment Company Act of 1940, (2) shares of a corporation which has a license or franchise from a governmental agency to conduct its business or is a member corporation of a national securities exchange registered under the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which license, franchise or membership is conditioned upon some or all of the holders of its stock possessing prescribed qualifications, to the extent necessary to prevent the loss of such license, franchise or membership or to reinstate it, or (3) shares of a professional corporation, as defined in Part 4 (commencing with Section 13400) of Division 3 of Title 1, shall be issued or redeemed unless the corporation at the time has outstanding a class of common shares that is not subject to redemption.
(d) Any 						redemption by a corporation of its shares shall be subject to the provisions of Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 500). Nothing in this section shall prevent a corporation from creating a sinking fund or similar provision for, or entering into an agreement for, the redemption or purchase of its shares to the extent permitted by Chapter 5, but unless such purchase or redemption is permitted under Chapter 5, the holder of shares to be so purchased or redeemed shall not become a creditor of the corporation.
(Amended by Stats. 2022, Ch. 617, Sec. 11. (SB 1202) Effective January 1, 2023.)
402.5.
  The rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions granted to or imposed upon a class or series of preferred shares (Section 176), the designation of which includes either the word “preferred” or the word “preference,” may:
(a) Notwithstanding paragraph (9) of subdivision (a) of Section 204, include a provision requiring a vote of a specified percentage or proportion of the outstanding shares of the class or series that is less than a majority of the class or series to approve any corporate action, except where the vote of a majority or greater proportion of the class or series is required by this division, regardless of restrictions or limitations on the voting rights thereof.
(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (5) of subdivision (a) of Section 204, provide that in addition to the requirement of subdivision (a) of Section 1900 the corporation may voluntarily wind up and dissolve only upon the vote of a specified percentage (which shall not exceed 662/3 percent) of such class or series.
(c) Notwithstanding subdivision (a) of Section 500, provide that a distribution may be made without regard to the preferential dividends arrears amount, or any preferential rights amount, or both, as described in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subdivision (a) of Section 500.
(Amended by Stats. 2014, Ch. 71, Sec. 22. (SB 1304) Effective January 1, 2015.)
403.
  (a) When so provided in the articles, a corporation may issue shares convertible within the time or upon the happening of one or more specified events and upon the terms and conditions that are stated in the articles if any of the following conditions apply:
(1) At the option of the holder or automatically upon either the vote of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of the class or series to be converted or upon the happening of one or more specified events, into shares 				 of any class or series.
(2) If it is a corporation which has a license or franchise from a governmental agency to conduct its business or a member corporation of a national securities exchange registered under the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the license, franchise or membership of which is conditioned upon some or all of the holders of its stock possessing prescribed qualifications, to the extent necessary to prevent the loss of such license, franchise or membership or to reinstate it, at the option of the corporation, into shares of any class or series or into any other security of the corporation.
(3) If the corporation is a “listed corporation” as defined in subdivision (d) of Section 301.5, both at the time of the original issuance of the convertible shares and at the time of the conversion, at the option of the corporation into shares of any class or series 				 or into any other security of the corporation, provided that any such securities received upon conversion are listed or qualified for trading on a stock exchange or market system defined in subdivision (d) of Section 301.5.
(b) Unless otherwise provided in the articles, a corporation may issue its debt securities convertible into other debt securities or into shares of the corporation within such time or upon the happening of one or more specified events and upon such terms and conditions as are fixed by the board.
(Amended by Stats. 1996, Ch. 477, Sec. 1. Effective January 1, 1997.)
404.
  Either in connection with the issue, subscription or sale of any of its shares, bonds, debentures, notes or other securities or independently thereof, a corporation may grant options to purchase or subscribe for shares of any class or series upon such terms and conditions as may be deemed expedient. Option rights may be transferable or nontransferable and separable or inseparable from other securities of the corporation.
(Added by Stats. 1975, Ch. 682.)
405.
  (a) If at the time of granting option or conversion rights or at any later time the corporation is not authorized by its articles to issue all the shares required for the satisfaction of the rights, if and when exercised, the additional number of shares required to be issued upon the exercise of such option or conversion rights shall be authorized by an amendment to the articles.
(b) If a corporation has obtained approval of the outstanding shares (Section 152) for the issue of options to purchase shares or of securities convertible into shares of the corporation, the board may, without 				 further approval of the outstanding shares (Section 152), amend the articles to increase the authorized shares of any class or series to such number as will be sufficient from time to time, when added to the previously authorized but unissued shares of such class or series, to satisfy any such option or conversion rights.
(Added by Stats. 1975, Ch. 682.)
406.
  Unless the articles provide otherwise, the board may issue shares, options or securities having conversion or option rights without first offering them to shareholders of any class.
(Added by Stats. 1975, Ch. 682.)
407.
  A corporation may, but is not required to, issue fractions of a share originally or upon transfer. If it does not issue fractions of a share, it shall in connection with any original issuance of shares (a) arrange for the disposition of fractional interests by those entitled thereto, (b) pay in cash the fair value of fractions of a share as of the time when those entitled to receive those fractions are determined or (c) issue scrip or warrants in registered form, as certificated securities or uncertificated securities, or bearer form as certificated securities, 				 which shall entitle the holder to receive a certificate for a full share upon the surrender of the scrip or warrants aggregating a full share; provided, however, that if the fraction of a share that any person would otherwise be entitled to receive in a merger, conversion, or reorganization is less than one-half of 1 percent of the total shares that person is entitled to receive, a merger, conversion, or reorganization agreement may provide that fractions of a share will be disregarded or that shares issuable in the merger or conversion will be rounded off to the nearest whole share; and provided, further, that a corporation may not pay cash for fractional shares if that action would result in the cancellation of more than 10 percent of the outstanding shares of any class. A determination by the board of the fair value of fractions of a share shall be conclusive in the absence of fraud. A certificate for a fractional share shall, but scrip or warrants shall not unless otherwise provided therein, entitle the 				 holder to exercise voting rights, to receive dividends thereon and to participate in any of the assets of the corporation in the event of liquidation. The board may cause scrip or warrants to be issued subject to the condition that they shall become void if not exchanged for full shares before a specified date or that the shares for which scrip or warrants are exchangeable may be sold by the corporation and the proceeds thereof distributed to the holder of the scrip or warrants or any other condition that the board may impose.
(Amended by Stats. 2002, Ch. 480, Sec. 2. Effective January 1, 2003.)
408.
  (a) A corporation may adopt and carry out a stock purchase plan or agreement or stock option plan or agreement providing for the issue and sale for such consideration as may be fixed of its unissued shares, or of issued shares acquired or to be acquired, to one or more of the employees or directors of the corporation or of a subsidiary or parent thereof or to a trustee on their behalf and for the payment for such shares in installments or at one time, and may provide for aiding any such persons in paying for such shares by compensation for services rendered, promissory notes or otherwise.
(b) A stock purchase plan or agreement or stock option plan or agreement may include, among other features, the fixing of eligibility for participation therein, the class and price of shares to be issued or sold under the plan or agreement, the number of shares which may be subscribed for, the method of payment therefor, the reservation of title until full payment therefor, the effect of the termination of employment, an option or obligation on the part of the corporation to repurchase the shares upon termination of employment, subject to the provisions of Chapter 5, restrictions upon transfer of the shares and the time limits of and termination of the plan.
(c) Sections 406 and 407 of the Labor Code shall not apply to shares issued by any foreign or domestic corporation to the following persons:
(1) Any employee of the 				 corporation or of any parent or subsidiary thereof, pursuant to a stock purchase plan or agreement or stock option plan or agreement provided for in subdivision (a).
(2) In any transaction in connection with securing employment, to a person who is or is about to become an officer of the corporation or of any parent or subsidiary thereof.
(Amended by Stats. 1982, Ch. 266, Sec. 1.)
409.
  (a) Shares may be issued:
(1) For such consideration as is determined from time to time by the board, or by the shareholders if the articles so provide, consisting of any or all of the following: money paid; labor done; services actually rendered to the corporation or for its benefit or in its formation or reorganization; debts or securities canceled; and tangible or intangible property actually received either by the issuing corporation or by a wholly owned subsidiary; but neither promissory notes of the purchaser (unless adequately secured by collateral other than the 				 shares acquired or unless permitted by Section 408) nor future services shall constitute payment or part payment for shares of the corporation; or
(2) As a share dividend or upon a stock split, reverse stock split, reclassification of outstanding shares into shares of another class, conversion of outstanding shares into shares of another class, exchange of outstanding shares for shares of another class or other change affecting outstanding shares.
(b) Except as provided in subdivision (d), shares issued as provided in this section or Section 408 shall be declared and taken to be fully paid stock and not liable to any further call nor shall the holder thereof be liable for any further payments under the provisions of this division. In the absence of fraud in the transaction, the judgment of the directors as to the value of the consideration for shares shall be conclusive.
(c) If the articles reserve to the shareholders the right to determine the consideration for the issue of any shares, such determination shall be made by approval of the outstanding shares (Section 152).
(d) A corporation may issue the whole or any part of its shares as partly paid and subject to call for the remainder of the consideration to be paid therefor. On the certificate issued to represent any such partly paid shares or, for uncertificated securities, on the initial transaction statement for such partly paid shares, the total amount of the consideration to be paid therefor and the amount paid thereon shall be stated. Upon the declaration of any dividend on fully paid shares, the corporation shall declare a dividend upon partly paid shares of the same class, but only upon the basis of the percentage of the consideration actually paid thereon.
(e) The board shall state by resolution its determination of the fair value to the corporation in monetary terms of any consideration other than money for which shares are issued. This subdivision does not affect the accounting treatment of any transaction, which shall be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
(Amended by Stats. 1986, Ch. 766, Sec. 13.)
410.
  (a) Every subscriber to shares and every person to whom shares are originally issued is liable to the corporation for the full consideration agreed to be paid for the shares.
(b) The full agreed consideration for shares shall be paid prior to or concurrently with the issuance thereof, unless the shares are issued as partly paid pursuant to subdivision (d) of Section 409, in which case the consideration shall be paid in accordance with the agreement of subscription or purchase.

  A transferee of shares for which the full agreed consideration has not been paid to the issuing corporation, who acquired them in good faith, without knowledge that they were not paid in full or to the extent stated on the certificate representing them or, in the case of uncertificated securities, on the applicable initial transaction statement, is liable only for the amount shown by the certificate or statement to be unpaid on the shares represented thereby, until the transferee transfers the shares to one who becomes liable therefor; provided that the transferor shall remain personally liable if so provided on the certificate or statement or agreed upon 				 in writing. The liability of any holder of such shares who derives title through such a transferee and who is not a party to any fraud affecting the issue of the shares is the same as that of the transferee through whom title is derived.
(Amended by Stats. 1986, Ch. 766, Sec. 14.)
412.
  Every transferee of partly paid shares who acquired them under a certificate or initial transaction statement showing the fact of part payment, and every transferee of such shares (other than a transferee who derives title through a holder in good faith without knowledge and who is not a party to any fraud affecting the issue of such shares) who acquired them with actual knowledge that the full agreed consideration had not been paid to the extent stated on the certificate or initial transaction statement, is personally liable to the corporation for installments of the amount unpaid becoming due until the shares are transferred to one who becomes liable 				 therefor; provided that the transferor shall remain personally liable if so provided on the certificate, initial transaction statement, or written statement, or agreed upon in writing.
(Amended by Stats. 1986, Ch. 766, Sec. 15.)
413.
  A person holding shares as pledgee, executor, administrator, guardian, conservator, trustee, receiver or in any representative or fiduciary capacity is not personally liable for any unpaid balance of the subscription price of the shares because the shares are so held but the estate and funds in the hands of such fiduciary or representative are liable and the shares are subject to sale therefor.
(Amended by Stats. 1979, Ch. 730.)
414.
  (a) No action shall be brought by or on behalf of any creditor to reach and apply the liability, if any, of a shareholder to the corporation to pay the amount due on such shareholder’s shares unless final judgment has been rendered in favor of the creditor against the corporation and execution has been returned unsatisfied in whole or in part or unless such proceedings would be useless.
(b) All creditors of the corporation, with or without reducing their claims to judgment, may intervene in any such creditor’s action to reach and apply unpaid subscriptions and any or all shareholders who hold 				 partly paid shares may be joined in such action. Several judgments may be rendered for and against the parties to the action or in favor of a receiver for the benefit of the respective parties thereto.
(c) All amounts paid by any shareholder in any such action shall be credited on the unpaid balance due the corporation upon such shareholder’s shares.
(Added by Stats. 1975, Ch. 682.)
415.
  Nothing in this division shall be construed as a derogation of any rights or remedies which any creditor or shareholder may have against any promoter, shareholder, director, officer or the corporation because of participation in any fraud or illegality practiced upon such creditor or shareholder by any such person or by the corporation in connection with the issue or sale of shares or other securities or in derogation of any rights which the corporation may have by rescission, cancellation or otherwise because of any fraud or illegality practiced on it by any such person in connection with the issue or sale of shares or other securities.
(Added by Stats. 1975, Ch. 682.)
416.
  (a) Every holder of shares in a corporation shall be entitled to have a certificate signed in the name of the corporation by the chairperson or vice chairperson of the board or the president or a vice president and by the chief financial officer or an assistant treasurer or the secretary or any assistant secretary, certifying the number of shares and the class or series of shares owned by the shareholder. Any or all of the signatures on the certificate may be facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate has ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the 						corporation with the same effect as if such person were an officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.
(b) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), a corporation may adopt a system of issuance, recordation and transfer of its shares by electronic or other means not involving any issuance of certificates, including provisions for notice to purchasers in substitution for the required statements on certificates under Sections 417, 418, and 1302, and as may be required by the commissioner in administering the Corporate Securities Law of 1968, which system (1) has been approved by the United States Securities and Exchange 						Commission, (2) is authorized in any statute of the United States, or (3) is in accordance with Division 8 (commencing with Section 8101) of the Commercial Code. Any system so adopted shall not become effective as to issued and outstanding certificated securities until the certificates therefor have been surrendered to the corporation.
(Amended by Stats. 2015, Ch. 98, Sec. 7. (SB 351) Effective January 1, 2016.)
417.
  If the shares of the corporation are classified or if any class of shares has two or more series, there shall appear on the certificate or, in the case of uncertificated securities, the initial transaction statement and written statements, one of the following:
(a) A statement of the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to or imposed upon each class or series of shares authorized to be issued and upon the holders thereof.
(b) A summary of such rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions with reference to 				 the provisions of the articles and any certificates of determination establishing the same.
(c) A statement setting forth the office or agency of the corporation from which shareholders may obtain, upon request and without charge, a copy of the statement referred to in subdivision (a).
(Amended by Stats. 1986, Ch. 766, Sec. 17.)
418.
  (a) There shall also appear on the certificate, the initial transaction statement, and written statements (unless stated or summarized under subdivision (a) or (b) of Section 417) the statements required by all of the following clauses to the extent applicable:
(1) The fact that the shares are subject to restrictions upon transfer.
(2) If the shares are assessable or are not fully paid, a statement that they are assessable or the statements required by subdivision (d) of Section 409 if they are not fully 				 paid.
(3) The fact that the shares are subject to a voting agreement under subdivision (a) of Section 706 or an irrevocable proxy under subdivision (e) of Section 705 or restrictions upon voting rights contractually imposed by the corporation.
(4) The fact that the shares are redeemable.
(5) The fact that the shares are convertible and the period for conversion.
Any such statement or reference thereto (Section 174) on the face of the certificate, the initial transaction statement, and written statements required by paragraph (1) or (2) shall be conspicuous.
(b) Unless stated on the certificate, the initial transaction statement, and written statements as required by subdivision (a), no restriction upon 				 transfer, no right of redemption and no voting agreement under subdivision (a) of Section 706, no irrevocable proxy under subdivision (e) of Section 705, and no voting restriction imposed by the corporation shall be enforceable against a transferee of the shares without actual knowledge of such restriction, right, agreement or proxy. With regard only to liability to assessment or for the unpaid portion of the subscription price, unless stated on the certificate as required by subdivision (a), that liability shall not be enforceable against a transferee of the shares. For the purpose of this subdivision, “transferee” includes a purchaser from the corporation.
(c) All certificates representing shares of a close corporation shall contain in addition to any other statements required by this section, the following conspicuous legend on the face thereof: “This corporation is a close corporation. The number of holders of record of its shares of all 				 classes cannot exceed ____ [a number not in excess of 35]. Any attempted voluntary inter vivos transfer which would violate this requirement is void. Refer to the articles, bylaws and any agreements on file with the secretary of the corporation for further restrictions.”
(d) Any attempted voluntary inter vivos transfer of the shares of a close corporation which would result in the number of holders of record of its shares exceeding the maximum number specified in its articles is void if the certificate contains the legend required by subdivision (c).
(Amended by Stats. 1986, Ch. 766, Sec. 18.)
419.
  (a) A domestic or foreign corporation may issue a new share certificate or a new certificate for any other security in the place of any certificate theretofore issued by it, alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, and the corporation may require the owner of the lost, stolen or destroyed certificate or the owner’s legal representative to give the corporation a bond (or other adequate security) sufficient to indemnify it against any claim that may be made against it (including any expense or liability) on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate.
(b) If a corporation refuses to issue a new share certificate or other certificate in place of one theretofore issued by it, or by any corporation of which it is the lawful successor, alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the owner of the lost, stolen or destroyed certificate or the owner’s legal representative may bring an action in the superior court of the proper county for an order requiring the corporation to issue a new certificate in place of the one lost, stolen or destroyed.
(c) If the court is satisfied that the plaintiff is the lawful owner of the number of shares or other securities, or any part thereof, described in the complaint and that the certificate therefor has been lost, stolen or destroyed, and no sufficient cause has been shown why a new certificate should not be issued in place thereof, it shall make an order requiring the corporation to issue and 				 deliver to the plaintiff a new certificate for such shares or other securities. In its order the court shall direct that, prior to the issuance and delivery to the plaintiff of such new certificate, the plaintiff give the corporation a bond (or other adequate security) as to the court appears sufficient to indemnify the corporation against any claim that may be made against it (including any expense or liability) on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate.

  Neither a domestic nor foreign corporation nor its transfer agent or registrar is liable:
(a) For transferring or causing to be transferred on the books of the corporation to the surviving joint tenant or tenants any share or shares or other securities issued to two or more persons in joint tenancy, whether or not the transfer is made with actual or constructive knowledge of the existence of any understanding, agreement, condition or evidence that the shares or securities were held other than in 				 joint tenancy or of a breach of trust by any joint tenant.
(b) To a minor or incompetent person in whose name shares or other securities are of record on its books or to any transferee of or transferor to either for transferring the shares or other securities on its books at the instance of or to the minor or incompetent or for the recognition of or dealing with the minor or incompetent as a shareholder or security holder, whether or not the corporation, transfer agent or registrar had notice, actual or constructive, of the nonage or incompetency, unless a guardian or conservator of the property of the minor or incompetent has been appointed and the corporation, transfer agent or registrar has received written notice thereof.
(c) To any married person or to any transferee of such person for transferring shares or other securities on its books at the instance of the person in whose 				 name they are registered, without the signature of such person’s spouse and regardless of whether the registration indicates that the shares or other securities are community property, in the same manner as if such person were unmarried.
(d) For transferring or causing to be transferred on the books of the corporation shares or other securities pursuant to a judgment or order of a court which has been set aside, modified or reversed unless, prior to the registration of the transfer on the books of the corporation, written notice is served upon the corporation or its transfer agent in the manner provided by law for the service of a summons in a civil action, stating that an appeal or other further court proceeding has been or is to be taken from or with regard to such judgment or order. After the service of such notice neither the corporation nor its transfer agent has any duty to register the requested transfer until the corporation or its 				 transfer agent has received a certificate of the clerk of the court in which the judgment or order was entered or made, showing that the judgment or order has become final.
(e) The Commercial Code shall not affect the limitations of liability set forth in this section. Section 1100 of the Family Code shall be subject to the provisions of this section and shall not be construed to prevent transfers, or result in liability to the corporation, transfer agent or registrar permitting or effecting transfers, which comply with this section.
(Amended by Stats. 2002, Ch. 784, Sec. 89. Effective January 1, 2003.)
421.
  Each holder of shares of a close corporation, whether original or subsequent, by accepting the certificates for the shares which contain the legend required by subdivision (c) of Section 418 agrees and consents that such holder cannot make any transfer of shares which would violate the provisions of subdivision (d) of Section 418 and waives any right which such holder might otherwise have under any other law to sell such shares to a greater number of purchasers or to demand any registration thereof under the Securities Act of 1933, as now or hereafter amended, or as provided in any statute adopted in substitution therefor, or otherwise, so long as the corporation is a close 				 corporation.
(Added by Stats. 1975, Ch. 682.)
422.
  (a) When the articles are amended in any way affecting the statements contained in the certificates for outstanding shares, or it becomes desirable for any reason, in the discretion of the board, to cancel any outstanding certificate for shares and issue a new certificate therefor conforming to the rights of the holder, the board may order any holders of outstanding certificates for shares to surrender and exchange them for new certificates within a reasonable time to be fixed by the board.
(b) The order may provide that a holder of any certificates so ordered to be 				 surrendered is not entitled to vote or to receive dividends or exercise any of the other rights of shareholders until the holder has complied with the order, but such order operates to suspend such rights only after notice and until compliance. The duty of surrender of any outstanding certificates may also be enforced by civil action.
(c) When the articles are amended in any way affecting the statements contained in the initial transaction statement or other written statements for outstanding uncertificated securities, or it becomes desirable for any reason, in the discretion of the board, to amend, revise, or supersede outstanding initial transaction statements or written statements, the board may order the issuance and delivery to holders of record of amended, revised, or superseding initial transaction statements or written statements.
(Amended by Stats. 1986, Ch. 766, Sec. 19.)
423.
  (a) Shares are not assessable except as provided in this section or as otherwise provided by a statute other than this division. If the articles expressly confer such authority upon the corporation or the board, and subject to any limitations therein contained, the board may in its discretion levy and collect assessments upon all shares of any or all classes made subject to assessment by the articles. This authority is in addition to the right of the corporation to recover the unpaid subscription price of shares or the remainder of the consideration to be paid therefor.
(b) Every levy of an assessment shall: specify the amount thereof and to whom and 						where it is payable; fix, or if proceedings or filings with any governmental or other agency for any qualification, permit, registration or exemption therefrom are required as a condition precedent to the levy or payment of an assessment provide for the establishment of, a date on which the assessment is payable; fix a date, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days from the date on which the assessment is payable, on which such assessment becomes delinquent if not paid; and fix a date, not less than 15 nor more than 60 days from the date on which the unpaid assessment becomes delinquent, for the sale of delinquent shares. The levy also shall fix the hour and place of sale, which place shall be in the county where the corporation is required to keep a copy of its bylaws pursuant to Section 213, or if there is no such county, in Sacramento.
(c) On or before the date an assessment is payable, the secretary of the corporation shall give notice thereof in substantially the following form:
(Name of corporation in full. Location of principal office.)
Notice is hereby given that the board of directors on (date) has levied an assessment of (amount) per share upon the (name or designation of class or series of shares) of the corporation payable (to whom and where). Any shares upon which this assessment remains unpaid on (date fixed) will be delinquent. Unless payment is made before delinquency, the said shares, or as many of them as may be necessary, will be sold at (particular place) on (date) at (hour) of such date, to pay the delinquent assessment, together with a penalty of 5 percent of the amount of the assessment on such shares, or be forfeited 						to the corporation. (Name of secretary with location of office.)
(d) The notice shall be served personally upon each holder of record of shares assessed; provided, however, that in lieu of personal service the notice may be mailed to each such shareholder addressed to the last address of the shareholder appearing on the books of the corporation or given by the shareholder to the corporation for the purpose of notice, or if no such address appears or is given, at the place where the principal office of the corporation is located, and published once in some newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the principal office of the corporation is located. If there is no such newspaper in such county, the publication shall be made in some newspaper of general circulation in an adjoining county.
(e) The assessment is a lien upon the shares assessed from the time of personal service or the publication of the notice of assessment, unless the articles provide for such lien from the time of the levy. Unless otherwise provided by law, a transfer of the shares on the books of the corporation after the lien of an assessment has attached is a waiver of the lien unless a conspicuous legend is placed on the face of any certificate issued upon such transfer or, in the case of uncertificated securities, on the initial transaction statement, setting forth the information contained in the notice required by subdivision (c). Such legend shall be removed if the assessment on the shares evidenced by the certificate is paid or if the shares are sold to pay the assessment or forfeited for nonpayment.
(f) The date of sale of delinquent 						shares fixed in any levy of an assessment may be extended from time to time for not more than 30 days at a time by order of the board entered on the records of the corporation, or when the sale is restrained by order of a court. Notice of such extension shall be given by announcement by the secretary, or other person authorized to conduct the sale, made at the time and place of sale last theretofore fixed.
If a date of sale of delinquent shares is extended for more than five days the corporation shall cause a notice to be mailed to the shareholder or shareholders whose shares are to be the subject of such sale setting forth the date and time to which the date of sale 						has been extended.
(g) If payment is made after delinquency and before the sale, the shareholder shall pay a penalty of 5 percent of the amount of the assessment on the shares in addition to the assessment.
(h) At the place and time appointed in the notice of levy any officer or an agent of the corporation, shall, unless otherwise ordered by the board, sell or cause to be sold to the highest bidder for cash as many shares of each delinquent holder of the assessed shares as may be necessary to pay the assessment and charges 						thereon according to the notice.
The person offering at the sale to pay the assessment and penalty for the smallest number of shares is the highest bidder. The shares purchased shall be transferred to the highest bidder on the share register of the corporation on the payment of the assessment and penalty and a new certificate or initial transaction statement therefor issued to such highest bidder.
A corporation is not required to accept an offer for a fraction of a share.
(i) If no bidder offers to pay the amount due on the shares, together with the penalty of 5 percent thereof, the shares shall be forfeited to the corporation in satisfaction of the assessment and penalty thereon.
(j) After a sale or forfeiture of shares for nonpayment of an assessment, the holder or owner of delinquent shares shall, if they are certificated securities, surrender the certificate for such shares to the corporation for cancellation or, if they are uncertificated securities, have no further rights with respect to such shares. This duty may be enforced by order or decree of court and such holder or owner shall be liable for damages to the corporation for failure to surrender the certificate for cancellation upon demand without good cause or excuse.
Any certificate not so surrendered forthwith becomes null and void and ceases to be evidence of the right or title of the holder or any transferee to the shares purporting to be represented thereby, and neither the corporation nor the purchaser of such shares incurs any liability thereon to any such 						transferee.
The purchaser of any shares, at a sale for delinquent assessments thereon, whenever made, is entitled to the issue of a new certificate representing the shares so purchased.
(k) The certificate of the secretary or assistant secretary of the corporation is prima facie evidence of the time and place of sale and any postponement thereof, of the quantity and particular description of the shares sold, to whom, for what price, and of the fact of payment of the purchase money. The certificate shall be filed in the office of the corporation, and copies of the certificate, certified by the secretary or an assistant secretary of the corporation, are prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated.
(l) An assessment is not invalidated 						by a failure to publish the notice of assessment, nor by the nonperformance of any act required in order to enforce the payment of the assessment; but in case of any substantial error or omission in the course of proceedings for collection of an assessment on any shares, all previous proceedings, except the levy of the assessment, are void as to such shares, and shall be taken anew.
(m) No action shall be maintained to recover shares sold for delinquent assessments, upon the ground of irregularity in the assessment, irregularity or defect of the notice of sale, or defect or irregularity in the sale, unless the party seeking to maintain the action first pays or tenders to the corporation, or the party holding the shares sold, the sum for which the shares were sold, together with all subsequent assessments which may have been paid thereon and 						interest on such sums from the time they were paid. No such action shall be maintained unless it is commenced by the filing of a complaint and the issuing of a summons thereon within six months after the sale was made.
(n) The only remedy for the collection of an assessment on fully paid shares is sale or forfeiture of the shares unless (1) remedy by action is expressly authorized in the original articles or by an amendment of the articles adopted before August 21, 1933, or by an amendment adopted on or after August 21, 1933, by unanimous consent of the shareholders, and (2) unless a statement of such remedy appears on the face of any share certificate issued on or after August 21, 1933.

CHAPTER 5. Dividends and Reacquisitions of Shares [500 - 511]  ( Chapter 5 added by Stats. 1975, Ch. 682. )

500.
  (a) Neither a corporation nor any of its subsidiaries shall make any distribution to the corporation’s shareholders (Section 166) unless the board of directors has determined in good faith either of the following:
(1) The amount of retained earnings of the corporation immediately prior to the distribution equals or exceeds the sum of (A) the amount of the proposed distribution plus (B) the preferential dividends arrears amount.
(2) Immediately after the distribution, the value of the corporation’s assets would equal or exceed the sum of its total liabilities plus the preferential rights amount.
(b) For the purpose of applying paragraph (1) 				 of subdivision (a) to a distribution by a corporation, “preferential dividends arrears amount” means the amount, if any, of cumulative dividends in arrears on all shares having a preference with respect to payment of dividends over the class or series to which the applicable distribution is being made, provided that if the articles of incorporation provide that a distribution can be made without regard to preferential dividends arrears amount, then the preferential dividends arrears amount shall be zero. For the purpose of applying paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) to a distribution by a corporation, “preferential rights amount” means the amount that would be needed if the corporation were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution to satisfy the preferential rights, including accrued but unpaid dividends, of other shareholders upon dissolution that are superior to the rights of the shareholders receiving the distribution, provided that if the articles of incorporation provide that a distribution can be 				 made without regard to any preferential rights, then the preferential rights amount shall be zero. In the case of a distribution of cash or property in payment by the corporation in connection with the purchase of its shares, (1) there shall be added to retained earnings all amounts that had been previously deducted therefrom with respect to obligations incurred in connection with the corporation’s repurchase of its shares and reflected on the corporation’s balance sheet, but not in excess of the principal of the obligations that remain unpaid immediately prior to the distribution and (2) there shall be deducted from liabilities all amounts that had been previously added thereto with respect to the obligations incurred in connection with the corporation’s repurchase of its shares and reflected on the corporation’s balance sheet, but not in excess of the principal of the obligations that will remain unpaid after the distribution, provided that no addition to retained earnings or deduction from liabilities 				 under this subdivision shall occur on account of any obligation that is a distribution to the corporation’s shareholders (Section 166) at the time the obligation is incurred.
(c) The board of directors may base a determination that a distribution is not prohibited under subdivision (a) or under Section 501 on any of the following:
(1) Financial statements prepared on the basis of accounting practices and principles that are reasonable under the circumstances.
(2) A fair valuation.
(3) Any other method that is reasonable under the circumstances.
(d) The effect of a distribution under paragraph (1) or (2) of subdivision (a) is measured as of the date the distribution is authorized if the 				 payment occurs within 120 days after the date of authorization.
(e) (1) If terms of indebtedness provide that payment of principal and interest is to be made only if, and to the extent that, payment of a distribution to shareholders could then be made under this section, indebtedness of a corporation, including indebtedness issued as a distribution, is not a liability for purposes of determinations made under paragraph (2) of subdivision (a).
(2) If indebtedness is issued as a distribution, each payment of principal or interest on the indebtedness shall be treated as a distribution, the effect of which is measured on the date the payment of the indebtedness is actually made.
(f) This section does not apply to a corporation licensed as a broker-dealer under Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 				 25210) of Part 3 of Division 1 of Title 4, if immediately after giving effect to any distribution the corporation is in compliance with the net capital rules of the Commissioner of Financial Protection and Innovation and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
(Amended by Stats. 2022, Ch. 452, Sec. 45. (SB 1498) Effective January 1, 2023.)
501.
  Neither a corporation nor any of its subsidiaries shall make any distribution to the corporation’s shareholders (Section 166) if the corporation or the subsidiary making the distribution is, or as a result thereof would be, likely to be unable to meet its liabilities (except those whose payment is otherwise adequately provided for) as they mature.
(Repealed and added by Stats. 1975, Ch. 682.)
503.
  (a) The provisions of Sections 500 and 501 shall not apply to a purchase or redemption of shares of a deceased shareholder from the proceeds of insurance on the life of that shareholder in excess of the total amount of all premiums paid by the corporation for that insurance, in order to carry out the provisions of an agreement between the corporation and that shareholder to purchase or redeem those shares upon 				 the death of the shareholder.
(b) The provisions of Sections 500 and 501 shall not apply to the purchase or redemption of shares of a disabled shareholder from the proceeds of disability insurance applicable to the disabled shareholder in excess of the total amount of all premiums paid by the corporation for the insurance, in order to carry out the provisions of an agreement between the corporation and the shareholder to purchase or redeem shares upon the disability of the shareholder as defined within that policy. For the purposes of this subdivision, “disability insurance” means an agreement of indemnification against the insured’s loss of the ability to work due to accident or illness.
(Repealed and added by Stats. 2011, Ch. 203, Sec. 5. (AB 571) Effective January 1, 2012.)
504.
  (a) The provisions of Section 500 do not apply to a dividend declared by either of the following:
(1) A regulated investment company, as defined in the federal Internal Revenue Code, as amended, to the extent that the dividend is necessary to maintain the status of the corporation as a regulated investment company under the provisions of that code.
(2) A real estate investment trust, as defined in Part II of 				 Subchapter M of Chapter 1 of Subtitle A of the federal Internal Revenue Code, as amended, to the extent that the dividend is necessary to maintain the status of the corporation as a real estate investment trust under the provisions of that code.
(b) The provisions of this chapter do not apply to any purchase or redemption of shares redeemable at the option of the holder by a registered open-end investment company under the United States Investment Company Act of 1940, so long as the right of redemption remains unsuspended under the provisions of that statute and the articles and bylaws of the corporation.
(Amended by Stats. 2000, Ch. 112, Sec. 1. Effective January 1, 2001.)
505.
  Nothing in this chapter prohibits additional restrictions upon the declaration of dividends or the purchase or redemption of a corporation’s own shares by provision in the articles or bylaws or in any indenture or other agreement entered into by the corporation.
(Added by Stats. 1975, Ch. 682.)
506.
  (a) Any shareholder who receives any distribution prohibited by this chapter with knowledge of facts indicating the impropriety thereof is liable to the corporation for the benefit of all of the creditors or shareholders entitled to institute an action under subdivision (b) for the amount so received by the shareholder with interest thereon at the legal rate on judgments until paid, but not exceeding the 				 liabilities of the corporation owed to nonconsenting creditors at the time of the violation and the injury suffered by nonconsenting shareholders, as the case may be. For purposes of determining the value of any noncash property received in a distribution described in the preceding sentence, the shareholder receiving that illegal distribution shall be liable to the corporation for an amount equal to the fair market value of the property at the time of the illegal distribution plus interest thereon from the date of the distribution at the legal rate on judgments until paid, together with all reasonably incurred costs of appraisal or other valuation, if any, of that property, but not exceeding the liabilities of the corporation owed to nonconsenting creditors at the time of the violation and the injury suffered by nonconsenting shareholders, as the case may be.
(b) Suit may be brought in the name of the corporation to enforce the liability (1) to 				 creditors arising under subdivision (a) for a violation of Section 500 or 501 against any or all shareholders liable by any one or more creditors of the corporation whose debts or claims arose prior to the time of the distribution to shareholders and who have not consented thereto, whether or not they have reduced their claims to judgment, or (2) to shareholders arising under subdivision (a) for a violation of Section 500 against any or all shareholders liable by one or more holders of shares having preferential rights with respect to cumulative dividends in arrears, in the case of a violation of paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 500, or upon dissolution, in the case of a violation of paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) of Section 500, in each case who have not consented to the applicable distribution, without regard to the provisions in Section 800, and in each case to the extent the applicable shares with preferential rights were outstanding at the time of the distribution; provided that holders of 				 shares of preferential rights shall not have the right to bring suit in the name of the corporation under this subdivision unless the preferential dividends arrears amount, in the case of a violation of paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 500, or the preferential rights amount, in the case of a violation of paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) of Section 500, was greater than zero. A cause of action with respect to an obligation to return a distribution pursuant to this section shall be extinguished unless the action is brought within four years after the date the distribution is made.
(c) Any shareholder sued under this section may implead all other shareholders liable under this section and may compel contribution, either in that action or in an independent action against shareholders not joined in that action.
(d) Nothing contained in this section affects any liability 				 which any shareholder may have under Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 3439) of Title 2 of Part 2 of Division 4 of the Civil Code.
(Amended by Stats. 2011, Ch. 203, Sec. 8. (AB 571) Effective January 1, 2012.)
508.
  This chapter does not apply in connection with any proceeding for winding up and dissolution under Chapter 18 or 19.
(Added by Stats. 1975, Ch. 682.)
509.
  (a) A corporation may redeem any or all shares which are redeemable at its option by (1) giving notice of redemption as provided in subdivisions (b) and (c) or as otherwise provided in its articles of incorporation, and (2) payment or deposit of the redemption price of the shares as provided in its articles or deposit of the redemption price pursuant to subdivision (d).
(b) Subject to any provisions in the articles with respect to the notice required for redemption of shares, the corporation may give notice of the redemption of any or all shares subject to redemption by causing a notice of redemption to be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the principal 						office of the corporation is located at least once a week for two successive weeks, in each instance on any day of the week, commencing not earlier than 60 nor later than 20 days before the date fixed for redemption. The notice of redemption shall set forth all of the following:
(1) The class or series of shares or part of any class or series of shares to be redeemed.
(2) The date fixed for redemption.
(3) The redemption price.
(4) If the shares are certificated securities, the place at which the shareholders may obtain payment of the redemption price upon surrender of their share certificates.
(c) If 						the corporation gives notice of redemption pursuant to subdivision (b), it shall also mail a copy of the notice of redemption to each holder of record of shares to be redeemed as of the date of mailing or record date fixed in accordance with Section 701, addressed to the holder at the address of such holder appearing on the books of the corporation or given by the holder to the corporation for the purpose of notice, or if no such address appears or is given at the place where the principal office of the corporation is located, not earlier than 60 nor later than 20 days before the date fixed for redemption. Failure to comply with this subdivision does not invalidate the redemption of the shares.
(d) If, on or before any date fixed for redemption of redeemable shares, the corporation deposits with any bank or trust company in this state as a 						trust fund, (1) a sum sufficient to redeem, on the date fixed for redemption thereof, the shares called for redemption, (2) in the case of the redemption of any uncertificated securities, an officer’s certificate setting forth the holders thereof registered on the books of the corporation and the number of shares held by each, and (3) irrevocable instructions and authority to the bank or trust company to publish the notice of redemption thereof (or to complete publication if theretofore commenced) and to pay, on and after the date fixed for redemption or prior thereto, the redemption price of the shares to their respective holders upon the surrender of their share certificates, in the case of certificated securities, or the delivery of the officer’s certificate in the case of uncertificated securities, then from and after the date of the deposit (although before the date fixed for redemption) the shares 						called 						shall be redeemed and the dividends on those shares shall cease to accrue after the date fixed for redemption. The deposit shall constitute full payment of the shares to their holders and from and after the date of the deposit the shares shall no longer be outstanding and the holders thereof shall cease to be shareholders with respect to the shares and shall have no rights with respect thereto except the right to receive from the bank or trust company payment of the redemption price of the shares without interest, upon surrender of their certificates therefor, in the case of certificated securities, and any right to convert the shares which may exist and then continue for any period fixed by its terms.
In determining the holders of uncertificated securities, the bank or trust company shall be entitled to rely on any officer’s certificate deposited 						with it in accordance with this subdivision.
(Amended by Stats. 2022, Ch. 617, Sec. 13. (SB 1202) Effective January 1, 2023.)
510.
  (a) When a corporation reacquires its own shares, those shares are restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares, unless the articles prohibit the reissuance thereof.
(b) When a corporation reacquires authorized shares of a class or series and the articles prohibit the reissuance of those shares:
(1) If all of the authorized shares of that class or series, as the case may be, are reacquired, then (A) that 				 class or series is automatically eliminated, (B) in the case of reacquisition of all of the authorized shares of a series, the authorized number of shares of the class to which the shares belonged is reduced by the number of shares so reacquired, and (C) the articles shall be amended to eliminate any statement of rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions relating solely to that class or series.
(2) If less than all of the authorized shares but all of the issued and outstanding shares of that class or series, as the case may be, are reacquired, the authorized number of shares of the class or series is automatically reduced by the number of shares so reacquired, and the board shall determine either (A) to eliminate that class or series, whereupon the articles shall be amended to eliminate any statement of rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions relating solely to that class or series, or (B) not to eliminate that class or 				 series, whereupon the articles shall be amended to reflect that reduction of the number of authorized shares of that class or series by the shares so reacquired.
(3) If less than all of the authorized shares and less than all of the issued and outstanding shares of a class or series, as the case may be, are reacquired, the authorized number of shares of that class or series shall be automatically reduced by the number of shares reacquired, and the articles shall be amended to reflect that reduction.
(c) When a corporation reacquires authorized shares of a series of shares and the articles only prohibit the reissuance of those shares as shares of the same series:
(1) If all of the authorized shares of that series are reacquired, then that series is automatically eliminated, the articles shall be amended to eliminate 				 any statement of rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions relating solely to that series, and the board shall determine either (A) to return those shares to the status of authorized but undesignated shares of the class to which they belong or (B) to eliminate those shares entirely, whereupon the articles in either case shall be amended to reflect the reduction in the authorized shares of that series and the effect, if any, on the class to which that series belongs.
(2) If all of the issued and outstanding shares of that series (but less than all of the authorized shares of that series) are reacquired, the board shall determine either (A) to eliminate that series, whereupon the articles shall be amended to eliminate any statement of rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions relating solely to that series, or (B) not to eliminate that series, whereupon the articles shall be amended to reflect the return of the reacquired shares 				 to the status of authorized but undesignated shares of the class to which they belong.
(3) If less than all of the issued and outstanding shares of that series are reacquired, the authorized number of shares of that series shall be automatically reduced by the number of shares reacquired, and the board shall determine either (A) to return those shares to the status of authorized but undesignated shares of the class to which they belong, or (B) to eliminate those shares entirely, whereupon the articles in either case shall be amended to reflect the reduction in the authorized shares of that series and the effect, if any, on the class to which that series belongs.
(d) “Reacquires” as used in this section means that a corporation purchases, redeems, acquires by way of conversion to another class or series, or otherwise acquires its own shares or that issued and outstanding shares 				 cease to be outstanding.
(e) The provisions of this section are subject to any contrary or inconsistent provision in the articles.
(f) A certificate of amendment shall be filed in accordance with the requirements of Chapter 9 (commencing with Section 900) reflecting any elimination or reduction of authorized shares set forth in subdivisions (b) and (c), and any related elimination from the articles of the designation and the rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions of any series or class of stock that is eliminated, except that approval by the outstanding shares (Section 152) shall not be required to adopt any such amendment. Nothing contained in this section is intended to alter or otherwise affect the powers of the board to amend the articles as contemplated in Sections 202 and 401.
(Amended by Stats. 1995, Ch. 154, Sec. 5. Effective January 1, 1996.)

  Notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter, a negotiable instrument issued by a corporation for the purchase or redemption of shares shall be enforceable by a holder in due course (Section 3302 of the Commercial Code) without notice that it was issued for that purpose or by a person who acquired the instrument through such a holder.
(Added by Stats. 1978, Ch. 370.)

CHAPTER 6. Shareholders’ Meetings and Consents [600 - 605]  ( Chapter 6 added by Stats. 1975, Ch. 682. )

600.
  (a) Meetings of shareholders may be held at any place within or without this state as may be stated in or fixed in accordance with the bylaws. If no other place is stated or so fixed, shareholder meetings shall be held at the principal office of the corporation. Subject to any limitations in the articles or bylaws of the corporation, if authorized by the board of directors in its sole discretion, and subject to those guidelines and procedures as the board of directors may adopt, shareholders not physically present in person or by proxy at a meeting of shareholders may, by electronic transmission by and to the corporation (Sections 20 and 21), electronic video screen communication, conference telephone, or other means of remote 						communication, participate in a meeting of shareholders, be deemed present in person or by proxy, and vote at a meeting of shareholders, subject to subdivision (e).
(b) An annual meeting of shareholders shall be held for the election of directors on a date and at a time stated in or fixed in accordance with the bylaws. However, if the corporation is a regulated management company, a meeting of shareholders shall be held as required by the Federal Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. Sec. 80a-1, et seq.). Any other proper business may be transacted at the annual meeting. For purposes of this subdivision, “regulated management company” means a regulated investment company as defined in Section 851 of the federal Internal Revenue Code.
(c) If there is a failure to hold the annual meeting for a period of 60 days after the date designated therefor or, if no date has been 						designated, for a period of 15 months after the organization of the corporation or after its last annual meeting, the superior court of the proper county may summarily order a meeting to be held upon the application of any shareholder after notice to the corporation giving it an opportunity to be heard. The shares represented at the meeting, either in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote thereat shall constitute a quorum for the purpose of the meeting, notwithstanding any provision of the articles or bylaws or in this division to the contrary. The court may issue any orders as may be appropriate, including, without limitation, orders designating the time and place of the meeting, the record date for determination of shareholders entitled to vote, and the form of notice of the meeting.
(d) Special meetings of the shareholders may be called by the board, the chairperson of the board, the president, the holders of shares entitled to cast not 						less than 10 percent of the votes at the meeting, or any additional persons as may be provided in the articles or bylaws.
(e) A meeting of the shareholders may be conducted, in whole or in part, by electronic transmission by and to the corporation, electronic video screen communication, conference telephone, or other means of remote communication if the corporation implements reasonable measures: (1) to provide shareholders and proxyholders a reasonable opportunity to participate in the meeting and to vote on matters submitted to the shareholders, including an opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of the meeting concurrently with those proceedings, (2) if any shareholder or proxyholder votes or takes other action at the meeting by means of electronic transmission to the corporation, electronic video screen communication, conference telephone, or other means of remote communication, to maintain a record of that vote or action in its books 						and records, and (3) to verify that each person 						who has voted remotely is a shareholder or proxyholder. A corporation shall not conduct a meeting of shareholders solely by electronic transmission by and to the corporation, electronic video screen communication, conference telephone, or other means of remote communication unless one or more of the following conditions apply: (A) all of the shareholders consent; (B) the board determines it is necessary or appropriate because of an emergency, as defined in paragraph (5) of subdivision (i) of Section 207; or (C) notwithstanding the absence of consent from all shareholders pursuant to (A) or subdivision (b) of Section 20, the meeting is conducted on or before 						December 31, 2025, and includes a live audiovisual feed for the duration of the meeting. A de minimis disruption of an audio, visual, or audiovisual feed does not require a corporation to end a shareholder meeting under, or render the corporation out of compliance with, this subdivision.
(Amended by Stats. 2022, Ch. 951, Sec. 1.5. (AB 1780) Effective January 1, 2023.)
601.
  (a) Whenever shareholders are required or permitted to take any action at a meeting a written notice of the meeting shall be given not less than 10 (or, if sent by third-class mail, 30) nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting to each shareholder entitled to vote thereat. That notice shall state the place, date and hour of the meeting, the means of electronic transmission by and to the corporation (Sections 20 and 21), electronic video screen communication, conference telephone, or other means of remote communication, if any, by which shareholders may participate in that meeting, and (1) in the case of a special meeting, the general nature of the business to be transacted, and no other business may be transacted, or (2) in the case 						of the annual meeting, those matters that the board, at the time of the mailing of the notice, intends to present for action by the shareholders, but subject to the provisions of subdivision (f) any proper matter may be presented at the meeting for that action. The notice of any meeting at which directors are to be elected shall include the names of nominees intended at the time of the notice to be presented by the board for election.
(b) (1) Notice of a shareholders’ meeting or any report shall be given personally, by electronic transmission by the corporation, or by first-class mail, or, in the case of a corporation with outstanding shares held of record by 500 or more persons (determined as provided in Section 605) on the record date for the shareholders’ meeting, notice may also be sent third-class mail, or 						other means of written communication, addressed to the shareholder at the address of that shareholder appearing on the books of the corporation or given by the shareholder to the corporation for the purpose of notice, or if no address appears or is given, at the place where the principal office of the corporation is located or by publication at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the principal office is located. The notice or report shall be deemed to have been given at the time when delivered personally, sent by electronic transmission by the corporation, deposited in the mail, or sent by other means of written communication. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the notice of a shareholder’s meeting or any report may be sent by electronic communication or other means of remote communication if the board determines it is necessary or appropriate because of an emergency, as 						defined in paragraph (5) of subdivision (i) of Section 207. An affidavit of mailing or electronic transmission by the corporation, or electronic communication or other means of remote communication as permitted because of an emergency, of any notice or report in accordance with the provisions of this division, executed by the secretary, assistant secretary, or any transfer agent, shall be prima facie evidence of the giving of the notice or report.
(2) If any notice or report addressed to the shareholder at the address of that shareholder appearing on the books of the corporation is returned to the corporation by the United States Postal Service marked to indicate that the United States Postal Service is unable to deliver the notice or report to the shareholder at that address, all future notices or reports shall be deemed to have been 						duly given without further mailing if the same shall be available for the shareholder upon written demand of the shareholder at the principal office of the corporation for a period of one year from the date of the giving of the notice or report to all other shareholders.
(3) (A) Notice given by electronic transmission by the corporation under this subdivision shall be valid only if it complies with Section 20. Notwithstanding the foregoing, notice shall not be given by electronic transmission by the corporation under this subdivision after either of the following:
(i) The corporation is unable to deliver two consecutive notices to the shareholder by that means.
(ii) The inability to so deliver 						the notices to the shareholder becomes known to the secretary, any assistant secretary, the transfer agent, or other person responsible for the giving of the notice.
(B) This paragraph shall not apply if notices are provided by electronic communication or other means of remote communication as permitted because of an emergency.
(c) Upon request in writing to the corporation addressed to the attention of the chairperson of the board, president, vice president or secretary by any person (other than the board) entitled to call a special meeting of shareholders, the officer forthwith shall cause notice to be given to the shareholders entitled to vote that a meeting will be held at a time requested by the person or persons calling the meeting, not less than 35 nor more than 60 days after the receipt 						of the request. If the notice is not given within 20 days after receipt of the request, the persons entitled to call the meeting may give the notice or the superior court of the proper county shall summarily order the giving of the notice, after notice to the corporation giving it an opportunity to be heard. The procedure provided in subdivision (c) of Section 305 shall apply to that application. The court may issue orders as may be appropriate, including, without limitation, orders designating the time and place of the meeting, the record date for determination of shareholders entitled to vote, and the form of notice.
(d) When a shareholders’ meeting is adjourned to another time or place, unless the bylaws otherwise require and except as provided in this subdivision, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the 						time and place thereof (or the means of electronic transmission by and to the corporation or, electronic video screen communication, conference telephone, or other means of remote communication, if any, by which the shareholders may participate) are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting the corporation may transact any business that might have been transacted at the original 						meeting. If the adjournment is for more than 45 days or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.
(e) The transactions of any meeting of shareholders, however called and noticed, and wherever held, are as valid as though had at a meeting duly held after regular call and notice, if a quorum is present either in person or by proxy, and if, either before or after the meeting, each of the persons entitled to vote, not present in person or by proxy, provides a waiver of notice or consent to the holding of the meeting or an approval of the minutes thereof in writing. All those waivers, consents, and approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting. 						Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of and presence at the meeting, except when the person objects, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened and except that attendance at a meeting is not a waiver of any right to object to the consideration of matters required by this division to be included in the notice but not so included, if the objection is expressly made at the meeting. Neither the business to be transacted at nor the purpose of any regular or special meeting of shareholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice, consent to the holding of the meeting or approval of the minutes thereof, unless otherwise provided in the articles or bylaws, except as provided in subdivision (f).
(f) Any shareholder approval at a 						meeting, other than unanimous approval by those entitled to vote, pursuant to Section 310, 902, 1152, 1201, 1900, or 2007 shall be valid only if the general nature of the proposal so approved was stated in the notice of meeting or in any written waiver of notice.
(Amended by Stats. 2022, Ch. 617, Sec. 15. (SB 1202) Effective January 1, 2023.)
602.
  (a) Unless otherwise provided in the articles, a majority of the shares entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of the shareholders, but in no event shall a quorum consist of less than one-third (or, in the case of a mutual water company, 20 percent) of the shares entitled to vote at the meeting or, except in the case of a close corporation, of more than a majority of the shares entitled to vote at the meeting. Except as provided in subdivision (b), the affirmative vote of a majority of the 				 shares represented and voting at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is present (which shares voting affirmatively also constitute at least a majority of the required quorum) shall be the act of the shareholders, unless the vote of a greater number or voting by classes is required by this division or the articles.
(b) The shareholders present at a duly called or held meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to transact business until adjournment notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders to leave less than a quorum, if any action taken (other than adjournment) is approved by at least a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum or, if required by this division or the articles, the vote of a greater number or voting by classes.
(c) In the absence of a quorum, any meeting of shareholders may be adjourned from time to time by the vote of a majority 				 of the shares represented either in person or by proxy, but no other business may be transacted, except as provided in subdivision (b).
(Amended by Stats. 2000, Ch. 485, Sec. 8. Effective January 1, 2001.)
603.
  (a) Unless otherwise provided in the articles, any action that may be taken at any annual or special meeting of shareholders may be taken without a meeting and without prior notice, if a consent in writing, as specified in Section 195, setting forth the action so taken, shall be provided by the holders of outstanding shares having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize 				 or take that action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.
(b) Unless the consents of all shareholders entitled to vote have been solicited in writing, both of the following shall apply:
(1) Notice of any shareholder approval pursuant to Section 310, 317, 1152, 1201 (except for a reorganization as to which shareholders have the right, pursuant to Chapter 13 (commencing with Section 1300) to demand payment of cash for their shares), or 2007 without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given at least 10 days before the consummation of the action authorized by that approval. Notice shall be given as provided in subdivision (b) of Section 601.
(2) Prompt notice shall be given of the taking of any other corporate action approved by shareholders without a 				 meeting by less than unanimous written consent, to those shareholders entitled to vote who have not consented in writing. Notice shall be given as provided in subdivision (b) of Section 601.
(c) Any shareholder giving a written consent, or the shareholder’s proxyholders, or a transferee of the shares or a personal representative of the shareholder or their respective proxyholders, may revoke the consent personally or by proxy by a writing received by the corporation prior to the time that written consents of the number of shares required to authorize the proposed action have been filed with the secretary of the corporation, but may not do so thereafter. The revocation is effective upon its receipt by the secretary of the corporation.
(d) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), directors may not be elected by written consent except by unanimous written consent of all shares entitled to 				 vote for the election of directors; provided that the shareholders may elect a director to fill a vacancy, other than a vacancy created by removal, by the written consent of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote.
(Amended by Stats. 2013, Ch. 109, Sec. 1. (AB 457) Effective January 1, 2014.)
604.
  (a) Any form of proxy or written consent distributed to 10 or more shareholders of a corporation with outstanding shares held of record by 100 or more persons shall afford an opportunity on the proxy or form of written consent to specify a choice between approval and disapproval of each matter or group of related matters intended to be acted upon at the meeting for which the proxy is solicited or by such written consent, other than elections to office, and shall provide, subject to reasonable specified conditions, that where the person solicited specifies a choice with respect to any such matter the shares will be voted in accordance therewith.
(b) In any election of directors, any form of proxy in which the directors to be voted upon are named therein as candidates and which is marked by a shareholder “withhold” or otherwise marked in a manner indicating that the authority to vote for the election of directors is withheld shall not be voted for the election of a director.
(c) Failure to comply with this section shall not invalidate any corporate action taken, but may be the basis for challenging any proxy at a meeting and the superior court may compel compliance therewith at the suit of any shareholder.
(d) This section does not apply to any corporation with an outstanding class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or whose securities are exempted from such registration by Section 12(g)(2) of that 				 act.
(Amended by Stats. 1980, Ch. 501.)
605.
  (a) For the purpose of determining whether a corporation has outstanding shares held of record by 100 or more persons, shares shall be deemed to be “held of record” by each person who is identified as the owner of such shares on the record of shareholders maintained by or on behalf of the corporation, subject to the following:
(1) In any case where the record of shareholders has not been maintained in accordance with accepted practice, any additional person who would be 				 identified as such an owner on such record if it had been maintained in accordance with accepted practice shall be included as a holder of record.
(2) Shares identified as held of record by a corporation, a partnership, a limited liability company, a trust, whether or not the trustees are named, or other organization shall be included as so held by one person.
(3) Shares identified as held of record by one or more persons as trustees, executors, guardians, conservators, custodians or in other fiduciary capacities with respect to a single trust, estate or account shall be included as held of record by one person.
(4) Shares held by two or more persons as coowners shall be included as held by one person.
(5) Shares registered in substantially similar names, where the corporation (or other person soliciting proxies) has reason to believe because of the address or other indications that such names represent the same person, may be included as held of record by one person.
(b) Notwithstanding subdivision (a):
(1) Shares held, to the knowledge of the corporation (or other person soliciting proxies), subject to a voting trust, deposit agreement or similar arrangement shall be included as held of record by the record holders of the voting trust certificates, certificates of deposit, receipts or similar evidences of interest in such securities; provided, however, that the corporation (or other person soliciting proxies) may rely in good faith on such information as is received in response to its request from a nonaffiliated issuer of the certificates or evidences of interest.
(2) If the corporation (or other person soliciting proxies) knows or has reason to know that the form of holding shares of record is used primarily to circumvent the provisions of this section, the beneficial owners of such shares shall be deemed to be the record owners thereof.
(Amended by Stats. 1994, Ch. 1010, Sec. 65. Effective January 1, 1995.)
CHAPTER 7. Voting of Shares [700 - 711]  ( Chapter 7 added by Stats. 1975, Ch. 682. )

700.
  (a) Except as provided in Section 708 and except as may be otherwise provided in the articles, each outstanding share, regardless of class, shall be entitled to one vote on each matter submitted to a vote of shareholders.
(b) Any holder of shares entitled to vote on any matter may vote part of the shares in favor of the proposal and refrain from voting the remaining shares or vote them against the proposal, other than elections to office, but, if the shareholder fails to specify the number of shares such shareholder is voting affirmatively, it will be conclusively presumed that the 				 shareholder’s approving vote is with respect to all shares such shareholder is entitled to vote.
(Added by Stats. 1975, Ch. 682.)
701.
  (a) In order that the corporation may determine the shareholders entitled to notice of any meeting or to vote or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any other lawful action, the board may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not be more than 60 nor less than 10 days prior to the date of such meeting nor more than 60 days prior to any other action.
(b) If no record date is fixed:
(1) The record date for determining 				 shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders shall be at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is given or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held.
(2) The record date for determining shareholders entitled to give consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the board has been taken, shall be the day on which the first written consent is given.
(3) The record date for determining shareholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board adopts the resolution relating thereto, or the 60th day prior to the date of such other action, whichever is later.
(c) A determination of shareholders of 				 record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting unless the board fixes a new record date for the adjourned meeting, but the board shall fix a new record date if the meeting is adjourned for more than 45 days from the date set for the original meeting.
(d) Shareholders at the close of business on the record date are entitled to notice and to vote or to receive the dividend, distribution or allotment of rights or to exercise the rights, as the case may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any shares on the books of the corporation after the record date, except as otherwise provided in the articles or by agreement or in this division.
(Amended by Stats. 1977, Ch. 235.)
702.
  (a) Subject to subdivision (c) of Section 703, shares held by an administrator, executor, guardian, conservator or custodian may be voted by such holder either in person or by proxy, without a transfer of such shares into the holder’s name; and shares standing in the name of a trustee may be voted by the trustee, either in person or by proxy, but no trustee shall be entitled to vote shares held by such trustee without a transfer of such shares into the trustee’s name.
(b) Shares standing in the name of a receiver may be voted by such receiver; and shares held by or 				 under the control of a receiver may be voted by such receiver without the transfer thereof into the receiver’s name if authority to do so is contained in the order of the court by which such receiver was appointed.
(c) Subject to the provisions of Section 705 and except where otherwise agreed in writing between the parties, a shareholder whose shares are pledged shall be entitled to vote such shares until the shares have been transferred into the name of the pledgee, and thereafter the pledgee shall be entitled to vote the shares so transferred.
(d) Shares standing in the name of a minor may be voted and the corporation may treat all rights incident thereto as exercisable by the minor, in person or by proxy, whether or not the corporation has notice, actual or constructive, of the nonage, unless a guardian of the minor’s property has been appointed and written notice of such 				 appointment given to the corporation.
(e) If authorized to vote the shares by the power of attorney by which the attorney in fact was appointed, shares held by or under the control of an attorney in fact may be voted and the corporation may treat all rights incident thereto as exercisable by the attorney in fact, in person or by proxy, without the transfer of the shares into the name of the attorney in fact.
(Amended by Stats. 1985, Ch. 403, Sec. 13.)
703.
  (a) Shares standing in the name of another corporation, domestic or foreign, may be voted by an officer, agent, or proxyholder as the bylaws of the other corporation may prescribe or, in the absence of such provision, as the board of the other corporation may determine or, in the absence of that determination, by the chairperson of the board, president or any vice president of the other corporation, or by any other person authorized to do so by the chairperson of the board, president, or any vice president of the other corporation. Shares which are purported to be voted or any proxy purported to be executed in the name of a corporation (whether or not any title of the person signing is indicated) shall be 						presumed to be voted or the proxy executed in accordance with the provisions of this subdivision, unless the contrary is shown.
(b) Shares of a corporation owned by its subsidiary shall not be entitled to vote on any matter.

  (a) If shares stand of record in the names of two or more persons, whether fiduciaries, members of a partnership, joint tenants, tenants in common, spouses as community property, tenants by the entirety, voting trustees, persons entitled to vote under a shareholder voting agreement or otherwise, or if two or more persons (including proxyholders) have the same fiduciary relationship respecting the same shares, unless the secretary of the corporation is given written notice to the contrary and is furnished with a copy of the instrument or order appointing them or creating the relationship wherein it is so provided, their acts with respect to voting shall have the following effect:
(1) If only one votes, such act binds all.
(2) If more than one vote, the act of the majority so voting binds all.
(3) If more than one vote, but the vote is evenly split on any particular matter, each faction may vote the securities in question proportionately.
(b) If the instrument so filed or the registration of the shares shows that any such tenancy is held in unequal interests, a majority or even split for the purpose of this section shall be a majority or even split in interest.
(Amended by Stats. 2016, Ch. 50, Sec. 21. (SB 1005) Effective January 1, 2017.)
705.
  (a) Every person entitled to vote shares may authorize another person or persons to act by proxy with respect to such shares. Any proxy purporting to be executed in accordance with the provisions of this division shall be presumptively valid.
(b) No proxy shall be valid after the expiration of 11 months from the date thereof unless otherwise provided in the proxy. Every proxy continues in full force and effect until revoked by the person executing it prior to the vote pursuant thereto, except as otherwise provided in this section. Such revocation may be effected by a 				 writing delivered to the corporation stating that the proxy is revoked or by a subsequent proxy executed by the person executing the prior proxy and presented to the meeting, or as to any meeting by attendance at such meeting and voting in person by the person executing the proxy. The dates contained on the forms of proxy presumptively determine the order of execution, regardless of the postmark dates on the envelopes in which they are mailed.
(c) A proxy is not revoked by the death or incapacity of the maker unless, before the vote is counted, written notice of such death or incapacity is received by the corporation.
(d) Except when other provision shall have been made by written agreement between the parties, the recordholder of shares which such person holds as pledgee or otherwise as security or which belong to another shall issue to the pledgor or to the owner of such shares, 				 upon demand therefor and payment of necessary expenses thereof, a proxy to vote or take other action thereon.
(e) A proxy which states that it is irrevocable is irrevocable for the period specified therein (notwithstanding subdivision (c)) when it is held by any of the following or a nominee of any of the following:
(1) A pledgee.
(2) A person who has purchased or agreed to purchase or holds an option to purchase the shares or a person who has sold a portion of such person’s shares in the corporation to the maker of the proxy.
(3) A creditor or creditors of the corporation or the shareholder who extended or continued credit to the corporation or the shareholder in consideration of the proxy if the proxy states that it was given in consideration of such 				 extension or continuation of credit and the name of the person extending or continuing credit.
(4) A person who has contracted to perform services as an employee of the corporation, if a proxy is required by the contract of employment and if the proxy states that it was given in consideration of such contract of employment, the name of the employee and the period of employment contracted for.
(5) A person designated by or under an agreement under Section 706.
(6) A beneficiary of a trust with respect to shares held by the trust.
Notwithstanding the period of irrevocability specified, the proxy becomes revocable when the pledge is redeemed, the option or agreement to purchase is terminated or the seller no longer owns any shares of the corporation or dies, the debt of the 				 corporation or the shareholder is paid, the period of employment provided for in the contract of employment has terminated, the agreement under Section 706 has terminated, or the person ceases to be a beneficiary of the trust. In addition to the foregoing clauses (1) through (5), a proxy may be made irrevocable (notwithstanding subdivision (c)) if it is given to secure the performance of a duty or to protect a title, either legal or equitable, until the happening of events which, by its terms, discharge the obligations secured by it.
(f) A proxy may be revoked, notwithstanding a provision making it irrevocable, by a transferee of shares without knowledge of the existence of the provision unless the existence of the proxy and its irrevocability appears, in the case of certificated securities, on the certificate representing such shares, or in the case of uncertificated securities, on the initial transaction statement and written 				 statements.
(Amended by Stats. 1986, Ch. 766, Sec. 22.)
706.
  (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this division, an agreement between two or more shareholders of a corporation, if in writing and signed by the parties thereto, may provide that in exercising any voting rights the shares held by them shall be voted as provided by the agreement, or as the parties may agree or as determined in accordance with a procedure agreed upon by them, and the parties may but need not transfer the shares covered by such an agreement to a third party or parties with authority to vote them in accordance with the 				 terms of the agreement. Such an agreement shall not be denied specific performance by a court on the ground that the remedy at law is adequate or on other grounds relating to the jurisdiction of a court of equity.
(b) Shares in any corporation may be transferred by written agreement to trustees in order to confer upon them the right to vote and otherwise represent the shares for such period of time, not exceeding 10 years, as may be specified in the agreement. The validity of a voting trust agreement, otherwise lawful, shall not be affected during a period of 10 years from the date when it was created or last extended as hereinafter provided by the fact that under its terms it will or may last beyond such 10-year period. At any time within two years prior to the time of expiration of any voting trust agreement as originally fixed or as last extended as provided in this subdivision, one or more beneficiaries under the voting trust agreement may, 				 by written agreement and with the written consent of the voting trustee or trustees, extend the duration of the voting trust agreement with respect to their shares for an additional period not exceeding 10 years from the expiration date of the trust as originally fixed or as last extended as provided in this subdivision. A duplicate of the voting trust agreement and any extension thereof shall be filed with the secretary of the corporation and shall be open to inspection by a shareholder, a holder of a voting trust certificate or the agent of either, upon the same terms as the record of shareholders of the corporation is open to inspection.
(c) No agreement made pursuant to subdivision (a) shall be held to be invalid or unenforceable on the ground that it is a voting trust that does not comply with subdivision (b) or that it is a proxy that does not comply with Section 705.
(d) This section shall not invalidate any voting or other agreement among shareholders or any irrevocable proxy complying with subdivision (e) of Section 705, which agreement or proxy is not otherwise illegal.
(Amended by Stats. 1997, Ch. 136, Sec. 3. Effective January 1, 1998.)
707.
  (a) In advance of any meeting of shareholders the board may appoint inspectors of election to act at the meeting and any adjournment thereof. If inspectors of election are not so appointed, or if any persons so appointed fail to appear or refuse to act, the chairperson of any meeting of shareholders may, and on the request of any shareholder or a shareholder’s proxy shall, appoint inspectors of election (or persons to replace those who so fail or refuse) at the meeting. The number of inspectors shall be either one or three. If appointed at a meeting on the request of one or more shareholders or proxies, the majority of shares represented in person or by proxy shall determine whether one or three inspectors 						are to be appointed.
(b) The inspectors of election shall determine the number of shares outstanding and the voting power of each, the shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum and the authenticity, validity and effect of proxies, receive votes, ballots or consents, hear and determine all challenges and questions in any way arising in connection with the right to vote, count and tabulate all votes or consents, determine when the polls shall close, determine the result and do such acts as may be proper to conduct the election or vote with fairness to all shareholders.
(c) The inspectors of election shall perform their duties impartially, in good faith, to the best of their ability and as expeditiously as is practical. If there are three inspectors of election, the 						decision, act or certificate of a majority is effective in all respects as the decision, act or certificate of all. Any report or certificate made by the inspectors of election is prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.
(Amended by Stats. 2022, Ch. 617, Sec. 16. (SB 1202) Effective January 1, 2023.)
708.
  (a) Except as provided in Sections 301.5 and 708.5, every shareholder complying with subdivision (b) and entitled to vote at any election of directors may cumulate such shareholder’s votes and give one candidate a number of votes equal to the number of directors to be elected multiplied by the number of votes to which the shareholder’s shares are normally entitled, or distribute the shareholder’s votes on the same principle among as many candidates as the shareholder thinks fit.
(b) No shareholder shall be entitled to cumulate votes (i.e., cast for any candidate a number of votes greater than the number of votes that the shareholder normally is entitled to cast) unless the candidate or candidates’ names have been placed in nomination prior to the voting and the shareholder has given notice at the meeting prior to the voting of the shareholder’s intention to cumulate the shareholder’s votes. If any one shareholder has given that notice, all shareholders may cumulate their votes for candidates in nomination.
(c) Except as provided in Section 708.5, in any election of directors, the candidates receiving the highest number of affirmative votes of the shares entitled to be voted for them up to the number of directors to be elected by those shares are elected; votes against the director and votes withheld shall have no legal effect.
(d) Subdivision 				 (a) applies to the shareholders of any mutual water company organized or existing for the purpose of delivering water to its shareholders at cost on lands located within the boundaries of one or more reclamation districts now or hereafter legally existing in this state and created by or formed under the provisions of any statute of this state, but does not otherwise apply to the shareholders of mutual water companies unless their articles or bylaws so provide.
(e) Elections for directors need not be by ballot unless a shareholder demands election by ballot at the meeting and before the voting begins or unless the bylaws so require.
(Amended by Stats. 2006, Ch. 871, Sec. 1. Effective January 1, 2007.)

  (a) For purposes of this section,the following definitions shall apply:
(1) “Uncontested election” means an election of directors in which, at the expiration of the time fixed under the articles of incorporation or bylaws requiring advance notification of director candidates or, absent such a provision in the articles of incorporation or bylaws, at a time fixed by the board of directors that is not more than 14 days before notice is given of the meeting at which the election is 				 to occur, the number of candidates for election does not exceed the number of directors to be elected by the shareholders at that election.
(2) “Listed corporation” means a domestic corporation that qualifies as a listed corporation under subdivision (d) of Section 301.5.
(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (5) of subdivision (a) of Section 204, a listed corporation that has eliminated cumulative voting pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 301.5 may amend its articles of incorporation or bylaws to provide that, in an uncontested election, approval of the shareholders, as specified in Section 153, shall be required to elect a director.
(c) Notwithstanding subdivision (b) of Section 301, if an incumbent director fails to be elected by approval of the shareholders (Section 153) in an uncontested election of a listed 				 corporation that has amended its articles of incorporation or bylaws pursuant to subdivision (b), then, unless the incumbent director has earlier resigned, the term of the incumbent director shall end on the date that is the earlier of 90 days after the date on which the voting results are determined pursuant to Section 707 or the date on which the board of directors selects a person to fill the office held by that director pursuant to subdivision (d).
(d) Any vacancy on the board of directors resulting from any failure of a candidate to be elected by approval of the shareholders (Section 153) in an uncontested election of a listed corporation that has amended its articles of incorporation or bylaws pursuant to subdivision (b) shall be filled in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 305.
(Added by Stats. 2006, Ch. 871, Sec. 2. Effective January 1, 2007.)
709.
  (a) Upon the filing of an action therefor by any shareholder or by any person who claims to have been denied the right to vote, the superior court of the proper county shall try and determine the validity of any election or appointment of any director of any domestic corporation, or of any foreign corporation if the election was held or the appointment was made in this state. In the case of a foreign corporation the action may be brought at the option of the plaintiff in the county in which the corporation has its principal office in California or in the county in which the election was held or the appointment was made.
(b) Upon the filing of the 						complaint, and before any further proceedings are had, the court shall enter an order fixing a date for the hearing, which shall be within five days unless for good cause shown a later date is fixed, and requiring notice of the date for the hearing and a copy of the complaint to be served upon the corporation and upon the person whose purported election or appointment is questioned and upon any person (other than the plaintiff) whom the plaintiff alleges to have been elected or appointed, in the manner in which a summons is required to be served, or, if the court so directs, by registered mail; and the court may make such further requirements as to notice as appear to be proper under the circumstances.
(c) The court may determine the person entitled to the office of director or may order a new election to be held or appointment to be 						made, may determine the validity, effectiveness and construction of voting agreements and voting trusts, the validity of the issuance of shares and the right of persons to vote and may direct such other relief as may be just and proper.

(c) An amendment of the articles or a certificate of determination that includes a supermajority vote requirement shall be approved by at least as large a proportion of the outstanding shares (Section 152) as is required pursuant to that amendment or certificate of determination for the approval of the specified corporate action or actions.
(d) The amendments made to this section by the act amending this section in the 2001–02 Regular Session shall not affect the rights of minority shareholders existing under law.

  (a) The Legislature finds and declares that:
Many of the residents of this state are the legal and beneficial owners or otherwise the ultimate beneficiaries of shares of stock of domestic and foreign corporations, title to which may be held by a variety of intermediate owners as defined in subdivision (b). The informed and active involvement of such beneficial owners and beneficiaries in holding legal owners and, through them, management, accountable in their exercise of corporate power is essential to the interest of those beneficiaries and beneficial owners and to the economy and well-being of 				 this state.
The purpose of this section is to serve the public interest by ensuring that voting records are maintained and disclosed as provided in this section. In the event that by statute or regulation pursuant to the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. Sec. 1001 et seq.), there are imposed upon investment managers as defined in Sec. 2(38) thereof, duties substantially the same as those set forth in this section, compliance with those statutory or regulatory requirements by persons subject to this section shall be deemed to fulfill the obligations contained in this section.
This section shall be construed liberally to achieve that purpose.
(b) For purposes of this section, a person on whose behalf shares are voted includes, but is not limited to:
(1) A 				 participant or beneficiary of an employee benefit plan with regard to shares held for the benefit of the participant or beneficiary.
(2) A shareholder, beneficiary, or contract owner of any entity (or of any portfolio of any entity) as defined in Section 3(a) of the federal Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. Sec. 80a-1 et seq.), as amended, to the extent the entity (or portfolio) holds the shares for which the record is requested.
(c) For the purposes of this section, a person on whose behalf shares are voted does not include:
(1) A person who possesses the right to terminate or withdraw from the shareholder, contract owner, participant, or beneficiary relationship with any entity (or any portfolio of any entity) defined in subdivision (b). This exclusion does not apply in the event the right of termination or 				 withdrawal cannot be exercised without automatic imposition of a tax penalty. The right to substitute a relationship with an entity or portfolio, the shares of which are voted by or subject to the direction of the investment adviser (as defined in Section 2 of the federal Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. Sec. 80a-1 et seq.), as amended), of the prior entity or portfolio, or an affiliate of the investment adviser, shall not be deemed to be a right of termination or withdrawal within the meaning of this subdivision.
(2) A person entitled to receive information about a trust pursuant to Section 16061 of the Probate Code.
(3) A beneficiary, participant, contract owner, or shareholder whose interest is funded through the general assets of a life insurance company authorized to conduct business in this state.
(d) Every person possessing the power to vote shares of stock on behalf of another shall maintain a record of the manner in which the shares were voted. The record shall be maintained for a period of 12 consecutive months from the effective date of the vote.
(e) Upon a reasonable written request, the person possessing the power to vote shares of stock on behalf of another, or a designated agent, shall disclose the voting record with respect to any matter involving a specific security or securities in accordance with the following procedures:
(1) Except as set forth in paragraph (2), disclosure shall be made to the person making the request. The person making the disclosure may require identification sufficient to identify the person making the request as a person on whose behalf the shares were voted. A request for identification, if made, shall be reasonable, shall 				 be made promptly, and may include a request for the person’s social security number.
(2) If the person possessing the power to vote shares on behalf of another holds that power pursuant to an agreement entered into with a party other than the person making the request for disclosure, the person maintaining and disclosing the record pursuant to this section may, instead, make the requested disclosure to that party. Disclosure to that party shall be deemed compliance with the disclosure requirement of this section. If disclosure is made to that party and not to the person making the request, subdivision (i) shall not apply. However, nothing herein shall prohibit that party and the person possessing the power to vote on shares from entering into an agreement between themselves for the payment or assessment of a reasonable charge to defray expenses of disclosing the record.
(f) Where 				 the entity subject to the requirements of this section is organized as a unit investment trust as defined in Section 4(2) of the federal Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. Sec. 80a-1 et seq.), the open-ended investment companies underlying the unit investment trust shall promptly make available their proxy voting records to the unit investment trust upon evidence of a bona fide request for voting record information pursuant to subdivision (e).
(g) Signing a proxy on another’s behalf and forwarding it for disposition or receiving voting instructions does not constitute the power to vote. A person forwarding proxies or receiving voting instructions shall disclose the identity of the person having the power to vote shares upon reasonable written request by a person entitled to request a voting record under subdivision (c).
(h) For purposes of this section, if one or more 				 persons has the power to vote shares on behalf of another, unless a governing instrument provides otherwise, the person or persons may designate an agent who shall maintain and disclose the record in accordance with subdivisions (b) and (c).
(i) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of subdivision (e), or as otherwise provided by law or a governing instrument, a person maintaining and disclosing a record pursuant to this section may assess a reasonable charge to the requesting person in order to defray expenses of disclosing the record in accordance with subdivision (e). Disclosure shall be made within a reasonable period after payment is received.
(j) Upon the petition of any person who successfully brings an action pursuant to or to enforce this section, the court may award costs and reasonable attorney’s fees if the court finds that the defendant willfully violated this section. 				
(k) The obligation to maintain and disclose a voting record in accordance with subdivisions (b) and (c) shall commence January 1, 1990.

CHAPTER 8. Shareholder Derivative Actions [800- 800.]  ( Chapter 8 added by Stats. 1975, Ch. 682. )

800.
  (a) As used in this section, “corporation” includes an unincorporated association; “board” includes the managing body of an unincorporated association; “shareholder” includes a member of an unincorporated association; and “shares” includes memberships in an unincorporated association.
(b) No action may be instituted or maintained in right of any domestic or foreign corporation by any holder of shares or of voting trust certificates of the corporation unless both of the following conditions exist:
(1) The 				 plaintiff alleges in the complaint that plaintiff was a shareholder, of record or beneficially, or the holder of voting trust certificates at the time of the transaction or any part thereof of which plaintiff complains or that plaintiff’s shares or voting trust certificates thereafter devolved upon plaintiff by operation of law from a holder who was a holder at the time of the transaction or any part thereof complained of; provided, that any shareholder who does not meet these requirements may nevertheless be allowed in the discretion of the court to maintain the action on a preliminary showing to and determination by the court, by motion and after a hearing, at which the court shall consider such evidence, by affidavit or testimony, as it deems material, that (i) there is a strong prima facie case in favor of the claim asserted on behalf of the corporation, (ii) no other similar action has been or is likely to be instituted, (iii) the 				 plaintiff acquired the shares before there was disclosure to the public or to the plaintiff of the wrongdoing of which plaintiff complains, (iv) unless the action can be maintained the defendant may retain a gain derived from defendant’s willful breach of a fiduciary duty, and (v) the requested relief will not result in unjust enrichment of the corporation or any shareholder of the corporation; and
(2) The plaintiff alleges in the complaint with particularity plaintiff’s efforts to secure from the board such action as plaintiff desires, or the reasons for not making such effort, and alleges further that plaintiff has either informed the corporation or the board in writing of the ultimate facts of each cause of action against each defendant or delivered to the corporation or the board a true copy of the complaint which plaintiff proposes to file.
(c) In any action referred to in subdivision (b), at any time within 30 days after service of summons upon the corporation or upon any defendant who is an officer or director of the corporation, or held such office at the time of the acts complained of, the corporation or the defendant may move the court for an order, upon notice and hearing, requiring the plaintiff to furnish a bond as hereinafter provided. The motion shall be based upon one or both of the following grounds:
(1) That there is no reasonable possibility that the prosecution of the cause of action alleged in the complaint against the moving party will benefit the corporation or its shareholders.
(2) That the moving party, if other than the corporation, did not participate in the transaction complained of in any capacity.
The court on application of the 				 corporation or any defendant may, for good cause shown, extend the 30-day period for an additional period or periods not exceeding 60 days.
(d) At the hearing upon any motion pursuant to subdivision (c), the court shall consider such evidence, written or oral, by witnesses or affidavit, as may be material (1) to the ground or grounds upon which the motion is based, or (2) to a determination of the probable reasonable expenses, including attorneys’ fees, of the corporation and the moving party which will be incurred in the defense of the action. If the court determines, after hearing the evidence adduced by the parties, that the moving party has established a probability in support of any of the grounds upon which the motion is based, the court shall fix the amount of the bond, not to exceed fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), to be furnished by the plaintiff for reasonable expenses, including attorneys’ 				 fees, which may be incurred by the moving party and the corporation in connection with the action, including expenses for which the corporation may become liable pursuant to Section 317. A ruling by the court on the motion shall not be a determination of any issue in the action or of the merits thereof. If the court, upon the motion, makes a determination that a bond shall be furnished by the plaintiff as to any one or more defendants, the action shall be dismissed as to the defendant or defendants, unless the bond required by the court has been furnished within such reasonable time as may be fixed by the court.
(e) If the plaintiff shall, either before or after a motion is made pursuant to subdivision (c), or any order or determination pursuant to the motion, furnish a bond in the aggregate amount of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) to secure the reasonable expenses of the parties entitled to make the motion, the plaintiff has complied with 				 the requirements of this section and with any order for a bond theretofore made, and any such motion then pending shall be dismissed and no further or additional bond shall be required.
(f) If a motion is filed pursuant to subdivision (c), no pleadings need be filed by the corporation or any other defendant and the prosecution of the action shall be stayed until 10 days after the motion has been disposed of.
(Amended by Stats. 1982, Ch. 517, Sec. 186.)

900.
  (a) By complying with the provisions of this chapter, a corporation may amend its articles from time to time, in any and as many respects as may be desired, so long as its articles as amended contain only such provisions as it would be lawful to insert in original articles filed at the time of the filing of the amendment and, if a change in shares or the rights of shareholders or an exchange, 				 reclassification or cancellation of shares or rights of shareholders is to be made, such provisions as may be necessary to effect such change, exchange, reclassification or cancellation. It is the intent of the Legislature in adopting this section to exercise to the fullest extent the reserve power of the state over corporations and to authorize any amendment of the articles covered by the preceding sentence regardless of whether any provision contained in the amendment was permissible at the time of the original incorporation of the corporation.
(b) A corporation shall not amend its articles to add any statement or to alter any statement that may appear in the original articles of the initial street address and initial mailing address of the corporation, the names and addresses of the first directors, or the name and address of the initial agent, except to correct an error in the statement or to delete the information after the corporation has 				 filed a statement under Section 1502.
(Amended by Stats. 2012, Ch. 494, Sec. 5. (SB 1532) Effective January 1, 2013.)
901.
  Before any shares have been issued, any amendment of the articles may be adopted by a writing signed by a majority of the incorporators, if directors were not named in the original articles and have not been elected, or, if directors were named in the original articles or have been elected, by a majority of the directors.
(Added by Stats. 1975, Ch. 682.)

(d) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), an amendment deleting the initial street address and initial mailing address of the corporation, the names and addresses of the first directors, or the name and address of the initial agent may be adopted with approval by the board alone.
(e) Whenever the articles require for corporate action the vote of a larger proportion or of all of the shares of any class or series, or of a larger proportion or of all of the directors, 				 than is otherwise required by this division, the provision in the articles requiring such greater vote shall not be altered, amended or repealed except by such greater vote unless otherwise provided in the articles.
(f) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), any amendment reducing the vote required for an amendment pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 158 may not be adopted unless approved by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of each class of outstanding shares or such other vote as may then be specified by the articles of the corporation.
(Amended by Stats. 2012, Ch. 494, Sec. 6. (SB 1532) Effective January 1, 2013.)
903.

(2) Effect an 				 exchange, reclassification, or cancellation of all or part of the shares of such class, including a reverse stock split but excluding a stock split.

(4) Change the rights, preferences, privileges or restrictions of the shares of such class.
(5) Create a new class of shares having rights, preferences or privileges prior to the shares of such class, or increase the rights, preferences or privileges or the number of authorized shares of any class having rights, preferences or privileges prior to the shares of such class.
(6) In the case of preferred shares, divide the shares of any class into series having different rights, 				 preferences, privileges or restrictions or authorize the board to do so.
(7) Cancel or otherwise affect dividends on the shares of such class which have accrued but have not been paid.
(b) Different series of the same class shall not constitute different classes for the purpose of voting by classes except when a series is adversely affected by an amendment in a different manner than other shares of the same class.
(c) In addition to approval by a class as provided in subdivision (a), a proposed amendment must also be approved by the outstanding voting shares (Section 152).
(Amended by Stats. 1997, Ch. 136, Sec. 4. Effective January 1, 1998.)
904.
  (a) Except as provided in subdivision (b), if any amendment of the articles would make shares assessable or would authorize remedy by action for the collection of an assessment on fully paid shares, it shall be approved by all of the outstanding shares affected regardless of limitations or restrictions on the voting rights thereof.
(b) If a corporation is a mutual water company within the meaning of Section 2705 of the Public Utilities Code, an amendment of the articles to make the shares assessable or to amend prior article provisions authorizing assessment of shares 				 shall be approved by the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of any class affected by the amendment regardless of limitations or restrictions on the voting rights thereof. However, if the amendment would authorize remedy by action for the collection of an assessment on fully paid shares, the amendment shall be approved pursuant to subdivision (a).
(Amended by Stats. 1990, Ch. 677, Sec. 1.)
905.
  In the case of amendments adopted after the corporation has issued any shares, the corporation shall file a certificate of amendment, which shall consist of an officers’ certificate stating:
(a) The wording of the amendment or amended articles in accordance with Section 907;
(b) That the amendment has been approved by the board;
(c) If the amendment is one for which the approval of the outstanding shares (Section 152) is required, that the amendment was approved by the required vote 				 of shareholders in accordance with Section 902, 903 or 904; the total number of outstanding shares of each class entitled to vote with respect to the amendment; and that the number of shares of each class voting in favor of the amendment equaled or exceeded the vote required, specifying the percentage vote required of each class entitled to vote; and
(d) If the amendment is one which may be adopted with approval by the board alone, a statement of the facts entitling the board alone to adopt the amendment.
In the event of an amendment of the articles pursuant to a merger, the filing of the officers’ certificate and agreement pursuant to Section 1103 or a certificate of ownership pursuant to subdivision (d) of Section 1110 shall be in lieu of any filing required under this chapter.
(Amended by Stats. 1976, Ch. 641.)
906.
  In the case of amendments adopted by the incorporators or the board under Section 901, the corporation shall file a certificate of amendment signed and verified by a majority of the incorporators or of the board, as the case may be, which shall state that the signers thereof constitute at least a majority of the incorporators or of the board, that the corporation has issued no shares and that they adopt the amendment or amendments therein set forth. In the case of amendments adopted by the incorporators, the certificate shall also state that directors were not named in the original articles and have not been elected.
In the case of 				 amendments adopted by the board under Section 901, the corporation may file a certificate of amendment pursuant to Section 905 in lieu of a certificate of amendment pursuant to this section.
(Amended by Stats. 1978, Ch. 370.)
907.
  (a) The certificate of amendment shall establish the wording of the amendment or amended articles by one or more of the following means:
(1) By stating that the articles shall be amended to read as therein set forth in full.
(2) By stating that any provision of the articles, which shall be identified by the numerical or other designation given it in the articles or by stating the wording thereof, shall be stricken from the articles or shall be amended to read as set forth in the certificate.
(3) By stating that the provisions set forth therein shall be added to the articles.
(b) If the purpose of the amendment is to effect a stock split or reverse stock split or to reclassify, cancel, exchange, or otherwise change outstanding shares, the amended articles shall state the effect thereof on outstanding shares.
(c) In the event of an amendment to change the statement of authorized shares from a single class of shares to two classes, the shares outstanding immediately prior to the amendment are automatically considered to be the same number of shares of the common stock class. If the designation of only one of the two classes includes “common,” that class is the common stock class. If the designation of both classes or of neither class includes “common” but one of the two classes has limited or no voting 				 rights, the class whose voting rights are not limited is the common stock class for the purpose of this subdivision. This subdivision has no application if the amendment of articles includes a statement of the effect of the amendment on outstanding shares pursuant to subdivision (b).
(d) An amendment which adds or eliminates a stated par value or changes the stated par value and which does not also state the effect of the amendment on outstanding shares is not thereby subject to subdivision (b).
(Amended by Stats. 1985, Ch. 764, Sec. 1.)
908.
  Upon the filing of the certificate of amendment, the articles shall be amended in accordance with the certificate and any stock split, reverse stock split, reclassification, cancellation, exchange or other change in shares shall be effected, and a copy of the certificate, certified by the Secretary of State, is prima facie evidence of the performance of the conditions necessary to the adoption of the amendment.
(Amended by Stats. 1979, Ch. 711.)
909.
  A corporation formed for a limited period may at any time subsequent to the expiration of the term of its corporate existence, if it has continuously acted as a corporation and done business as such, extend the term of its existence by an amendment to its articles removing any provision limiting the term of its existence and providing for perpetual existence. If the filing of the certificate of amendment providing for perpetual existence would be prohibited if it were original articles by the provisions of Section 201, the Secretary of State shall not file such certificate unless by the same or a concurrently filed certificate of amendment the articles of such corporation are 				 amended to adopt a new available name. For the purpose of the adoption of any such amendment, persons who have been functioning as directors of such corporation shall be considered to have been validly elected even though their election may have occurred after the expiration of the original term of the corporate existence. The certificate of amendment shall set forth that the corporation continuously acted as a corporation and did business as such from the expiration of its term of corporate existence to the date of the amendment.
(Added by Stats. 1975, Ch. 682.)
910.
  (a) A corporation may restate in a single certificate the entire text of its articles as amended by filing an officers’ certificate or, in circumstances where incorporators or the board may amend a corporation’s articles pursuant to Sections 901 and 906, a certificate signed and verified by a majority of the incorporators or the board, as applicable, entitled Restated Articles of Incorporation, which shall set forth the articles as amended to the date of the filing of the certificate, except that the signatures and acknowledgments of the articles by the incorporators and any statements regarding the effect of any prior amendment upon outstanding shares and any provisions of agreements of merger (other than amendments to the articles of the surviving 						corporation) and the initial street address and initial mailing address of the corporation and the names and addresses of the first directors and of the initial agent for service of process shall be omitted (except that the initial street address and initial mailing address of the corporation, the names and addresses of the initial agent for service of process and, if previously set forth in the articles, the initial directors, shall not be omitted before the time that the corporation has filed a statement under Section 1502). Such omissions are not alterations or amendments of the articles. The certificate may also itself alter or amend the articles in any respect, in which case the certificate must comply with Section 905 or 906, as the case may be, and Section 907.
(b) If the certificate does not itself alter or amend the articles in 						any respect, it shall be approved by the board or, before the issuance of any shares and the naming and election of directors, by a majority of the incorporators, and shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter relating to an amendment of the articles not requiring any approval of the outstanding shares (Section 152). If the certificate does itself alter or amend the articles, it shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter relating to the amendment or amendments so made and, except for certificates approved by a majority of the incorporators, the certificate shall also state that the board has approved the restated articles.
(c) Certificates of determination are a part of the articles within the meaning of this section. The provisions of such a certificate shall be given an article designation in the restated articles.
(d) Restated articles of incorporation filed pursuant to this section shall supersede for all purposes the original articles and all amendments and certificates of determination filed prior thereto.

  (a) A corporation may, by amendment of its articles pursuant to this section, change its status to that of a social purpose corporation, nonprofit public benefit corporation, nonprofit mutual benefit corporation, nonprofit religious corporation, or cooperative corporation.
(b) The amendment of the articles to change status to a nonprofit corporation shall revise the statement of purpose, delete the authorization for shares and any other provisions relating to authorized or issued shares, make such other changes as may be necessary or desired, and, if any shares have been issued, provide either for the cancellation of those shares or for the conversion of those shares to memberships of 				 the nonprofit corporation. The amendment of the articles to change status to a cooperative corporation shall revise the statement of purpose, make such other changes as may be necessary or desired, and, if any shares have been issued, provide for the cancellation of those shares or for the conversion of those shares to memberships of the cooperative corporation, if necessary.
(c) If shares have been issued, an amendment to change status to a nonprofit corporation shall be approved by all of the outstanding shares of all classes regardless of limitations or restrictions on the voting rights thereof and an amendment to change status to a cooperative corporation shall be approved by the outstanding shares (Section 152) of each class regardless of limitations or restrictions on the voting rights thereof.
(d) In the case of a change of status to a social purpose corporation:
(1) The corporation shall modify the name of the corporation, revise the statement of purpose, include the statement required by subparagraph (B) of paragraph (3) of subdivision (b) of Section 2602, and make such other conforming changes as may be necessary or desired.
(2) The amendment shall be approved by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of each class, or a greater vote if required in the articles, of outstanding shares (Section 152) of that changing corporation.
(e) If an amendment pursuant to this section is included in a merger agreement, the provisions of this section apply, except that any provision for cancellation or conversion of shares shall be in the merger agreement rather than in the amendment of the articles.
(f) Notwithstanding 				 subdivision (c), if a corporation is a mutual water company within the meaning of Section 2705 of the Public Utilities Code and under the terms of the status change each outstanding share is converted to a membership of a nonprofit mutual benefit corporation, an amendment to change status to a nonprofit mutual benefit corporation shall be approved by the outstanding shares (Section 152) of each class regardless of limitations or restrictions on the voting rights thereof.

1000.
  Any mortgage, deed of trust, pledge or other hypothecation of all or any part of the corporation’s property, real or personal, for the purpose of securing the payment or performance of any contract or obligation may be approved by the board.

1001.
  (a) A corporation may sell, lease, convey, exchange, transfer, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets when the principal terms are approved by the board, and, unless the transaction is in the usual and regular course of its business, approved by the outstanding shares (Section 152), either before or after approval by the board and before or after the transaction. A transaction constituting a reorganization (Section 181) is subject to the provisions of Chapter 12 (commencing with Section 1200) and not this section (other than subdivision (d)). A transaction constituting a conversion (Section 161.9) is subject to the provisions of Chapter 11.5 (commencing with Section 1150) and not this section.
(b) Notwithstanding approval of the outstanding shares (Section 152), the board may abandon the proposed transaction without further action by the shareholders, subject to the contractual rights, if any, of third parties.
(c) The sale, lease, conveyance, exchange, transfer, or other disposition may be made upon those terms and conditions and for that consideration as the board may deem in the best interests of the corporation. The consideration may be money, securities, or other property.
(d) If the acquiring party in a transaction pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section or subdivision (g) of Section 2001 is in control of or under common control with the disposing corporation, the principal terms of the sale must 						be approved by at least 90 percent of the voting power of the disposing corporation unless the disposition is to a domestic or foreign corporation or other business entity in consideration of the nonredeemable common shares or nonredeemable equity securities of the acquiring party or its parent.
(e) Subdivision (d) does not apply to any transaction if the Commissioner of Financial Protection and Innovation, the Insurance Commissioner, or the Public Utilities Commission has approved the terms and conditions of the transaction and the fairness of those terms and conditions pursuant to Section 25142 of this code, or Section 1209, 5750, or 5802 of the Financial Code, Section 838.5 of the Insurance Code, or Section 822 of the Public Utilities Code.

1002.
  Any deed or instrument conveying or otherwise transferring any assets of a corporation may have annexed to it the certificate of the secretary or an assistant secretary of the corporation, setting forth that the transaction has been validly approved by the board and (a) stating that the property described in said deed or instrument is less than substantially all of the assets of the corporation or that the transfer is in the usual and regular course of the business of the corporation, if such be the case, or (b) if such property constitutes all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation and the transfer is not in the usual and regular course of the business of the 				 corporation, stating the fact of approval thereof by the outstanding shares (Section 152) pursuant to this chapter or Chapter 12, as the case may be, or that such approval is not required by Chapter 12. Such certificate is prima facie evidence of the existence of the facts authorizing such conveyance or other transfer of the assets and conclusive evidence in favor of any innocent purchaser or encumbrancer for value.

The agreement shall state all of the following:
(1) The terms and conditions of the merger.
(2) The amendments, subject to Sections 900 and 907, to the articles of the surviving corporation to be effected by the merger, if any. If any amendment changes the name of the surviving corporation the new name may be the same as or 						similar to the name of a disappearing domestic or foreign corporation, subject to subdivision (b) of Section 201.
(3) The name and place of incorporation of each constituent corporation and which of the constituent corporations is the surviving corporation.
(4) The manner of converting the shares of each of the constituent corporations into shares or other securities of the surviving corporation and, if any shares of any of the constituent corporations are not to be converted solely into shares or other securities of the surviving corporation, the cash, rights, securities, or other property which the holders of those shares are to receive in exchange for the shares, which cash, rights, securities, or other property may be in addition to or in lieu of shares or other securities of 						the surviving corporation, or that the shares are canceled without consideration.
(5) Other details or provisions as are desired, if any, including, without limitation, a provision for the payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares or for any other arrangement with respect thereto consistent with the provisions of Section 407.

Notwithstanding paragraph 						(4) of subdivision (a), except in a short-form merger, and in the merger of a corporation into its subsidiary in which it owns at least 90 percent of the outstanding shares of each class, the nonredeemable common shares or nonredeemable equity securities of a constituent corporation may be converted only into nonredeemable common shares of the surviving party or a parent party if a constituent corporation or its parent owns, directly or indirectly, before the merger shares of another constituent corporation representing more than 50 percent of the voting power of the other constituent corporation before the merger, unless all of the shareholders of the class consent and except as provided in Section 407.
(Amended by Stats. 2022, Ch. 617, Sec. 20. (SB 1202) Effective January 1, 2023.)
1101.1.
  Subdivision (c) of Section 1113 and subdivision (b) of Section 1101 do not apply to any transaction if the Commissioner of Financial Protection and Innovation, the Insurance Commissioner, or the Public Utilities Commission has approved the terms and conditions of the transaction and the fairness of those terms and conditions pursuant to Section 25142 or Section 1209, 5750, or 5802 of the Financial Code, Section 838.5 of the Insurance Code, or Section 822 of the Public Utilities Code.
(Amended by Stats. 2022, Ch. 617, Sec. 21. (SB 1202) Effective January 1, 2023.)

(Amended by Stats. 2015, Ch. 98, Sec. 9. (SB 351) Effective January 1, 2016.)
1103.
  After approval of a merger by the board and any approval of the outstanding shares (Section 152) required by Chapter 12 (commencing with Section 1200), the surviving corporation shall file a copy of the agreement of merger with an officers’ certificate of each constituent corporation attached stating the total number of outstanding shares of each class entitled to vote on the merger, that the principal terms of the agreement in the form attached were approved by that corporation by a vote of a number of shares of each class which equaled or exceeded the vote 				 required, specifying each class entitled to vote and the percentage vote required of each class, or that the merger agreement was entitled to be and was approved by the board alone under the provisions of Section 1201. If equity securities of a parent of a constituent corporation are to be issued in the merger, the officers’ certificate of that constituent corporation shall state either that no vote of the shareholders of the parent was required or that the required vote was obtained. The merger and any amendment of the articles of the surviving corporation contained in the merger agreement shall thereupon be effective (subject to subdivision (c) of Section 110 and subject to the provisions of Section 1108) and the several parties thereto shall be one corporation. The Secretary of State may certify a copy of the merger agreement separate from the officers’ certificates attached thereto.
(Amended by Stats. 2006, Ch. 773, Sec. 1. Effective September 29, 2006.)
1104.
  Any amendment to the agreement may be adopted and the agreement so amended may be approved by the board and, if it changes any of the principal terms of the agreement, by the outstanding shares (Section 152) (if required by Chapter 12) of any constituent corporation in the same manner as the original agreement. If the agreement so amended is approved by the board and the outstanding shares (if required) of each of the corporations, the agreement so amended shall then constitute the agreement of merger.
(Amended by Stats. 1979, Ch. 711.)
1105.
  The board may, in its discretion, abandon a merger, subject to the contractual rights, if any, of third parties, including other constituent corporations, without further approval by the outstanding shares (Section 152), at any time before the merger is effective.
(Repealed and added by Stats. 1975, Ch. 682.)
1106.
  A copy of an agreement of merger certified on or after the effective date by an official having custody thereof has the same force in evidence as the original and, except as against the state, is conclusive evidence of the performance of all conditions precedent to the merger, the existence on the effective date of the surviving corporation and the performance of the conditions necessary to the adoption of any amendment to the articles contained in the agreement of merger.
(Amended by Stats. 1976, Ch. 641.)
1107.
  (a) Upon merger pursuant to this chapter the separate existence of the disappearing corporations ceases and the surviving corporation shall succeed, without other transfer, to all the rights and property of each of the disappearing corporations and shall be subject to all the debts and liabilities of each in the same manner as if the surviving corporation had itself incurred them.
(b) For purposes of subdivision (a), a surviving corporation may succeed without the payment of any 				 local agency transfer fee to all licenses, permits, registrations, and other privileges granted by any local agency provided the merger does not result in a change of ownership. Examples of mergers that do not result in a change of ownership are mergers between any of the following: (1) a corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary; (2) a corporation and the wholly owned subsidiary of that corporation’s wholly owned subsidiary; or (3) two wholly owned subsidiaries of the same parent corporation. The surviving corporation shall be subject to the same duties and obligations in connection with the license, permit, registration, or other privileges acquired from the disappearing corporations.
(c) All rights of creditors and all liens upon the property of each of the constituent corporations shall be preserved unimpaired, provided that any liens upon property of a disappearing corporation shall be limited to the property affected thereby immediately 				 prior to the time the merger is effective.
(d) Any action or proceeding pending by or against any disappearing corporation may be prosecuted to judgment, which shall bind the surviving corporation, or the surviving corporation may be proceeded against or substituted in its place.
(e) Nothing in subdivision (b) shall limit or restrict a tax assessor from reassessing real property upon transfer of title. Privileges granted by any local agency do not include property tax assessments.
(f) Nothing in subdivision (b) shall limit or restrict a local agency from reevaluating privileges received by a successor corporation from disappearing corporations if the local agency determines in its sole discretion that the reevaluation is necessary for public health, safety, or welfare purposes.
(g) For purposes of this section, “local agency” means a county, city, city and county, political subdivision, district, or municipal corporation.

1107.5.
  (a) Upon merger pursuant to this chapter, a surviving domestic or foreign corporation or other business entity shall be deemed to have assumed the liability of each disappearing domestic or foreign corporation or other business entity that is taxed under Part 10 (commencing with Section 17001) of, or under Part 11 (commencing with Section 23001) of, Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code for the following:

(b) If the surviving corporation is a domestic corporation, the merger proceedings with respect to that 				 corporation and any domestic disappearing corporation shall conform to the provisions of this chapter governing the merger of domestic corporations, but if the surviving corporation is a foreign corporation, then, subject to the requirements of subdivision (d) and of Section 407 and Chapters 12 (commencing with Section 1200) and 13 (commencing with Section 1300) (with respect to any domestic constituent corporations), the merger proceedings may be in accordance with the laws of the state or place of incorporation of the surviving corporation.
(c) If the surviving corporation is a domestic corporation, the agreement and the officers’ certificate of each domestic or foreign constituent corporation shall be filed as provided in Section 1103, or the certificate of ownership shall be filed as provided in Section 1110, and thereupon, subject to subdivision (c) of Section 110, the merger shall be effective as to each domestic constituent corporation; 				 and each foreign disappearing corporation that is qualified for the transaction of intrastate business shall by virtue of the filing, subject to subdivision (c) of Section 110, automatically surrender its right to transact intrastate business.

(e) If the date of the filing in this state pursuant to subdivision (d) is 				 more than six months after the time of the effectiveness in the foreign jurisdiction, or if the powers of the domestic corporation are suspended at the time of effectiveness in the foreign jurisdiction, the merger shall be effective as to the domestic disappearing corporation or corporations as of the date of filing in this state. Each foreign disappearing corporation that is qualified for the transaction of intrastate business shall, by virtue of the filing pursuant to subdivision (d), automatically surrender its right to transact intrastate business as of the date of filing in this state regardless of the time of effectiveness as to a domestic disappearing corporation.
(f) The provisions of the last two sentences of Section 1101 and Chapter 12 (commencing with Section 1200) and Chapter 13 (commencing with Section 1300) apply to the rights of the shareholders of any of the constituent corporations that are domestic corporations and of any 				 domestic corporation that is a parent party of any foreign constituent corporation.

The resolution or plan of merger shall provide for the merger and shall provide that the surviving corporation assumes all the liabilities of each disappearing corporation and shall include any other provisions required by this section.
(b) If the parent corporation owns less than all the outstanding shares but at least 90 percent of the outstanding shares of each class of the subsidiary corporation that is a party to the merger, the resolution or plan of merger also shall set forth the securities, cash, property, or rights to be issued, paid, delivered, or granted upon surrender of each outstanding share of the subsidiary corporation not owned by the parent corporation and the entire resolution or plan of merger as well as the consideration to be received for each share of the subsidiary corporation not owned by the parent corporation, shall be approved by the board 				 of that subsidiary corporation.
(c) If the parent corporation is to be merged into one of its subsidiary corporations, the resolution or plan of merger also shall provide for the pro rata conversion of the outstanding shares of the parent corporation into shares of the surviving subsidiary corporation. In this case, the entire resolution or plan of merger shall be approved by the board of the surviving subsidiary corporation and, if the merger, but for the operation of this section, would be a merger reorganization (Section 181) the principal terms of which would be required to be approved by the outstanding shares (Section 152) of any class of the parent corporation pursuant to subdivision (d) of Section 1201, the principal terms of the resolution or plan of merger shall be approved by the outstanding shares (Section 152) of that same class of the parent corporation.
(d) In any 				 merger pursuant to this section, the resolution or plan of merger may provide for the amendment of the articles of the surviving corporation to change its name, subject to Section 201, regardless of whether the name so adopted is the same as or similar to that of one of the disappearing corporations. The provision shall establish the wording of the amendment pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) of Section 907 and the resolution or plan of merger shall not provide for the amendment of the articles of the surviving corporation other than to change its name.

In lieu of an officers’ certificate, a certificate of merger, on a form prescribed by the Secretary of State, shall be filed for each constituent other business entity.

(5) If the date of the filing in this state pursuant to this subdivision is 				 more than six months after the time of the effectiveness in the foreign jurisdiction, or if the powers of a domestic disappearing corporation are suspended at the time of effectiveness in the foreign jurisdiction, the merger shall be effective as to the domestic disappearing corporation as of the date of filing in this state.
(6) In a merger described in paragraph (3) or (4), each foreign disappearing corporation that is qualified for the transaction of intrastate business shall by virtue of the filing pursuant to this subdivision, subject to subdivision (c) of Section 110, automatically surrender its right to transact intrastate business in this state. The filing of the agreement of merger or certificate of merger, as is applicable, pursuant to this subdivision, by a disappearing foreign other business entity registered for the transaction of intrastate business in this state shall, by virtue of that filing, subject to subdivision (c) of 				 Section 110, automatically cancels the registration for that foreign other business entity, without the necessity of the filing of a certificate of cancellation.

CHAPTER 12. Reorganizations [1200 - 1203]  ( Chapter 12 added by Stats. 1975, Ch. 682. )

1200.
  A reorganization (Section 181) or a share exchange tender offer (Section 183.5) shall be approved by the board of:
(a) Each constituent corporation in a merger reorganization;
(b) The acquiring corporation in an exchange reorganization;
(c) The acquiring corporation and the corporation whose property and assets are acquired in a sale-of-assets reorganization;
(d) The acquiring corporation in a share exchange tender offer (Section 183.5); and
(e) The corporation in control of any constituent or acquiring domestic or foreign corporation or other business entity under subdivision (a), (b) or (c) and whose equity securities are issued, transferred, or exchanged in the reorganization (a “parent party”).
(Amended by Stats. 1999, Ch. 437, Sec. 11. Effective January 1, 2000.)
1201.
  (a) The principal terms of a reorganization shall be approved by the outstanding shares (Section 152) of each class of each corporation the approval of whose board is required under Section 1200, except as provided in subdivision (b) and except that (unless otherwise provided in the articles) no approval of any class of outstanding preferred shares of the surviving or acquiring corporation or parent party shall be required if the rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions granted to or imposed upon that class of shares remain unchanged (subject to the provisions of subdivision (c)). For the purpose of this subdivision, two classes of common shares differing only as to voting rights shall be considered as a single class of shares.
(b) No approval of the outstanding shares (Section 152) is required by subdivision (a) in the case of any corporation if that corporation, or its shareholders immediately before the reorganization, or both, shall own (immediately after the reorganization) equity securities, other than any warrant or right to subscribe to or purchase those equity securities, of the surviving or acquiring corporation or a parent party (subdivision (e) of Section 1200) possessing more than five-sixths of the voting power of the surviving or acquiring corporation or parent party. In making the determination of ownership by the shareholders of a corporation, immediately after the reorganization, of equity securities pursuant to the preceding sentence, equity securities which they owned immediately before the reorganization as shareholders of another party to the 						transaction shall be disregarded. For the purpose of this section only, the voting power of a corporation shall be calculated by assuming the conversion of all equity securities convertible (immediately or at some future time) into shares entitled to vote but not assuming the exercise of any warrant or right to subscribe to or purchase those shares.
(c) Notwithstanding subdivision (b), the principal terms of a reorganization shall be approved by the outstanding shares (Section 152) of the surviving corporation in a merger reorganization if any amendment is made to its articles that would otherwise require that approval.
(d) Notwithstanding subdivision (b), the principal terms of a reorganization shall be approved by the outstanding shares (Section 152) of any class of a 						corporation that is a party to a merger or sale-of-assets reorganization if holders of shares of that class 						receive shares of the surviving or acquiring corporation or parent party having different rights, preferences, privileges, or restrictions than those surrendered. Shares in a foreign corporation received in exchange for shares in a domestic corporation have different rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions within the meaning of the preceding sentence.
(e) Notwithstanding subdivisions (a) and (b), the principal terms of a reorganization shall be approved by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of each class, or a greater vote if required in the articles, of the outstanding shares (Section 152) of any close corporation if the reorganization would result in their receiving shares of a corporation that is not a close corporation. However, the articles may provide for a lesser vote, but not less than a majority 						of the outstanding shares of each class.
(f) Notwithstanding subdivisions (a) and (b), the principal terms of a reorganization shall be approved by at least two-thirds of each class, or a greater vote if required in the articles, of the outstanding shares (Section 152) of a corporation that is a party to a merger reorganization if holders of shares receive shares of a surviving social purpose corporation in the merger.
(g) Notwithstanding subdivisions (a) and (b), the principal terms of a reorganization shall be approved by the outstanding shares (Section 152) of any class of a corporation that is a party to a merger reorganization if holders of shares of that class receive interests of a surviving other business entity in the merger.
(h) Notwithstanding subdivisions (a) and (b), the principal terms of a reorganization shall be approved by all shareholders of any class or series if, as a result of the reorganization, the holders of that class or series become personally liable for any obligations of a party to the reorganization, unless all holders of that class or series have the dissenters’ rights provided in Chapter 13 (commencing with Section 1300).
(i) Any approval required by this section may be given before or after the approval by the board. Notwithstanding approval required by this section, the board may abandon the proposed reorganization without further action by the shareholders, subject to the contractual rights, if any, of third parties.
(Amended by Stats. 2022, Ch. 617, Sec. 22. (SB 1202) Effective January 1, 2023.)
1201.5.
  (a) The principal terms of a share exchange tender offer (Section 183. 5) shall be approved by the outstanding shares (Section 152) of each class of the corporation making the tender offer or whose shares are to be used in the tender offer, except as provided in subdivision (b) and except that (unless otherwise provided in the articles) no approval of any class of outstanding preferred shares of either corporation shall be required, if the rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions granted to or imposed upon that class of shares remain unchanged. For the purpose of this subdivision, two classes of common shares differing only 				 as to voting rights shall be considered as a single class of shares.
(b) No approval of the outstanding shares (Section 152) is required by subdivision (a) in the case of any corporation if the corporation, or its shareholders immediately before the tender offer, or both, shall own (immediately after the completion of the share exchange proposed in the tender offer) equity securities, (other than any warrant or right to subscribe to or purchase the equity securities), of the corporation making the tender offer or of the corporation whose shares were used in the tender offer, possessing more than five-sixths of the voting power of either corporation. In making the determination of ownership by the shareholders of a corporation, immediately after the tender offer, of equity securities pursuant to the preceding sentence, equity securities which they owned immediately before the tender offer as shareholders of another party to the transaction shall 				 be disregarded. For the purpose of this section only, the voting power of a corporation shall be calculated by assuming the conversion of all equity securities convertible (immediately or at some future time) into shares entitled to vote but not assuming the exercise of any warrant or right to subscribe to, or purchase, shares.
(Amended by Stats. 1990, Ch. 616, Sec. 2.)
1202.
  (a) In addition to the requirements of Section 1201, the principal terms of a merger reorganization shall be approved by all the outstanding shares of a corporation if the agreement of merger provides that all the outstanding shares of that corporation are canceled without consideration in the merger.
(b) In addition to the requirements of Section 1201, if the terms of a merger reorganization or sale-of-assets reorganization provide that a class or series of preferred shares is to have distributed to it a lesser amount than would be required by applicable article 				 provisions, the principal terms of the reorganization shall be approved by the same percentage of outstanding shares of that class or series which would be required to approve an amendment of the article provisions to provide for the distribution of that lesser amount.
(c) If a parent party within the meaning of Section 1200 is a foreign corporation (other than a foreign corporation to which subdivision (a) of Section 2115 is applicable), any requirement or lack of a requirement for approval by the outstanding shares of the foreign corporation shall be based, not on the application of Sections 1200 and 1201, but on the application of the laws of the state or place of incorporation of the foreign corporation.
(Added by Stats. 1988, Ch. 919, Sec. 7.)
1203.
  (a) If a tender offer, including a share exchange tender offer (Section 183.5), or a written proposal for approval of a reorganization subject to Section 1200 or for a sale of assets subject to subdivision (a) of Section 1001 is made to some or all of a corporation’s shareholders by an interested party (herein referred to as an “Interested Party Proposal”), an affirmative opinion in writing as to the fairness of the consideration to the shareholders of that corporation shall be delivered as follows:
(1) If no shareholder approval or acceptance is required for the 				 consummation of the transaction, the opinion shall be delivered to the corporation’s board of directors not later than the time that consummation of the transaction is authorized and approved by the board of directors.
(2) If a tender offer is made to the corporation’s shareholders, the opinion shall be delivered to the shareholders at the time that the tender offer is first made in writing to the shareholders. However, if the tender offer is commenced by publication and tender offer materials are subsequently mailed or otherwise distributed to the shareholders, the opinion may be omitted in that publication if the opinion is included in the materials distributed to the shareholders.
(3) If a shareholders’ meeting is to be held to vote on approval of the transaction, the opinion shall be delivered to the shareholders with the notice of the meeting (Section 601).
(4) If consents of all shareholders entitled to vote are solicited in writing (Section 603), the opinion shall be delivered at the same time as that solicitation.
(5) If the consents of all shareholders are not solicited in writing, the opinion shall be delivered to each shareholder whose consent is solicited prior to that shareholder’s consent being given, and to all other shareholders at the time they are given the notice required by subdivision (b) of Section 603.
For purposes of this section, the term “interested party” means a person who is a party to the transaction and (A) directly or indirectly controls the corporation that is the subject of the tender offer or proposal, (B) is, or is directly or indirectly controlled by, an officer or director of the subject corporation, or (C) is an entity in which a material financial interest 				 (subdivision (a) of Section 310) is held by any director or executive officer of the subject corporation. For purposes of the preceding sentence, “any executive officer” means the president, any vice president in charge of a principal business unit, division, or function such as sales, administration, research, development, or finance, and any other officer or other person who performs a policymaking function or has the same duties as those of a president or vice president. The opinion required by this subdivision shall be provided by a person who is not affiliated with the offeror and who, for compensation, engages in the business of advising others as to the value of properties, businesses, or securities. The fact that the opining person previously has provided services to the offeror or a related entity or is simultaneously engaged in providing advice or assistance with respect to the proposed transaction in a manner which makes its compensation contingent on the success of the proposed transaction shall 				 not, for those reasons, be deemed to affiliate the opining person with the offeror. Nothing in this subdivision shall limit the applicability of the standards of review of the transaction in the event of a challenge thereto under Section 310 or subdivision (c) of Section 1312.
This subdivision shall not apply to an Interested Party Proposal if the corporation that is the subject thereof does not have shares held of record by 100 or more persons (determined as provided in Section 605), or if the transaction has been qualified under Section 25113 or 25121 and no order under Section 25140 or subdivision (a) of Section 25143 is in effect with respect to that qualification.
(b) If a tender of shares or a vote or written consent is being sought pursuant to an Interested Party Proposal and a later tender offer or written proposal for a reorganization subject to Section 1200 or sale of assets subject to 				 subdivision (a) of Section 1001 that would require a vote or written consent of shareholders is made to the corporation or its shareholders (herein referred to as a “Later Proposal”) by any other person at least 10 days prior to the date for acceptance of the tendered shares or the vote or notice of shareholder approval on the Interested Party Proposal, then each of the following shall apply:
(1) The shareholders shall be informed of the Later Proposal and any written material provided for this purpose by the later offeror shall be forwarded to the shareholders at that offeror’s expense.
(2) The shareholders shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to withdraw any vote, consent, or proxy previously given before the vote or written consent on the Interested Party Proposal becomes effective, or a reasonable time to withdraw any tendered shares before the purchase of the shares 				 pursuant to the Interested Party Proposal. For purposes of this subdivision, a delay of 10 days from the notice or publication of the Later Proposal shall be deemed to provide a reasonable opportunity or time to effect that withdrawal.
(Amended by Stats. 1990, Ch. 216, Sec. 9.)

The fair market value shall be determined as of the day of, and immediately prior to, the first announcement of the terms of the proposed reorganization or short-form merger, excluding any appreciation or depreciation in consequence of the proposed reorganization or 				 short-form merger, as adjusted for any stock split, reverse stock split, or share dividend that becomes effective thereafter.
(b) As used in this chapter, “dissenting shares” means shares to which all of the following apply:
(1) That were not, immediately prior to the reorganization or short-form merger, listed on any national securities exchange certified by the Commissioner of Financial Protection and Innovation under subdivision (o) of Section 25100, and the notice of meeting of shareholders to act upon the reorganization summarizes this section and Sections 1301, 1302, 1303, and 1304; provided, however, that this provision does not apply to any shares with respect to which there exists any restriction on transfer imposed by the corporation or by any law or regulation; and provided, further, that this provision does not apply to any shares where the holder of those shares is 				 required, by the terms of the reorganization or short-form merger, to accept for the shares anything except: (A) shares of any other corporation, which shares, at the time the reorganization or short-form merger is effective, are listed on any national securities exchange certified by the Commissioner of Financial Protection and Innovation under subdivision (o) of Section 25100; (B) cash in lieu of fractional shares described in the foregoing subparagraph (A); or (C) any combination of the shares and cash in lieu of fractional shares described in the foregoing subparagraphs (A) and (B).
(2) That were outstanding on the date for the determination of shareholders entitled to vote on the reorganization and (A) were not voted in favor of the reorganization or, (B) if described in paragraph (1), were voted against the reorganization, or were held of record on the effective date of a short-form merger; provided, however, that subparagraph (A) rather 				 than subparagraph (B) of this paragraph applies in any case where the approval required by Section 1201 is sought by written consent rather than at a meeting.
(3) That the dissenting shareholder has demanded that the corporation purchase at their fair market value, in accordance with Section 1301.
(4) That the dissenting shareholder has submitted for endorsement, in accordance with Section 1302.
(c) As used in this chapter, “dissenting shareholder” means the recordholder of dissenting shares and includes a transferee of record.

  (a) If, in the case of a reorganization, any shareholders of a corporation have a right under Section 1300, subject to compliance with paragraphs (3) and (4) of subdivision (b) thereof, to require the corporation to purchase their shares for cash, that corporation shall mail to each of those shareholders a notice of the approval of the reorganization by its outstanding shares (Section 152) within 10 days 				 after the date of that approval, accompanied by a copy of Sections 1300, 1302, 1303, and 1304 and this section, a statement of the price determined by the corporation to represent the fair market value of the dissenting shares, and a brief description of the procedure to be followed if the shareholder desires to exercise the shareholder’s right under those sections. The statement of price constitutes an offer by the corporation to purchase at the price stated any dissenting shares as defined in subdivision (b) of Section 1300, unless they lose their status as dissenting shares under Section 1309.
(b) Any shareholder who has a right to require the corporation to purchase the shareholder’s shares for cash under Section 1300, subject to compliance with paragraphs (3) and (4) of subdivision (b) thereof, and who desires the corporation to purchase shares shall make written demand upon the corporation for the purchase of those shares and payment to 				 the shareholder in cash of their fair market value. The demand is not effective for any purpose unless it is received by the corporation or any transfer agent thereof (1) in the case of shares described in subdivision (b) of Section 1300, not later than the date of the shareholders’ meeting to vote upon the reorganization, or (2) in any other case, within 30 days after the date on which the notice of the approval by the outstanding shares pursuant to subdivision (a) or the notice pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1110 was mailed to the shareholder.
(c) The demand shall state the number and class of the shares held of record by the shareholder which the shareholder demands that the corporation purchase and shall contain a statement of what the shareholder claims to be the fair market value of those shares as determined pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 1300. The statement of fair market value constitutes an offer by the shareholder to 				 sell the shares at that price.
(Amended by Stats. 2012, Ch. 473, Sec. 2. (AB 1680) Effective January 1, 2013.)
1302.

Unless otherwise provided by the articles or bylaws and if approved by the board of directors, that report and any accompanying material sent pursuant to this section may be sent by electronic transmission by the corporation (Section 20).

(2) Unless so waived, the report specified in paragraph (1) shall be sent to the shareholders at least 15 (or, if sent by third-class mail, 35) days before the annual meeting of shareholders to be held during the next fiscal year, but this requirement shall not limit the requirement for holding an annual meeting as required by Section 600.

(1) Any transaction (excluding compensation of officers and directors) during the previous fiscal year involving an amount in excess of forty thousand dollars ($40,000) (other than contracts let at competitive bid or services rendered at prices regulated by law) to which the corporation or its parent or subsidiary was a party and in which any director or officer of the corporation or of a subsidiary or (if 						known to the corporation or its parent or subsidiary) any holder of more than 10 percent of the outstanding voting shares of the corporation had a direct or indirect material interest, naming the person and stating the person’s relationship to the corporation, the nature of the person’s interest in the transaction and, where practicable, the amount of the interest; provided that in the case of a transaction with a partnership of which the person is a partner, only the interest of the partnership need be stated; and provided further that no report need be made in the case of any transaction approved by the shareholders (Section 153).
(2) The amount and circumstances of any indemnification or advances aggregating more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) paid during the fiscal year to any officer or director of the corporation pursuant 						to Section 317; provided that no report need be made in the case of indemnification approved by the shareholders (Section 153) under paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 317.

A shareholder or shareholders holding at least 5 percent of the outstanding shares of any class of a corporation may make a written request to the corporation for an income statement of the corporation for the three-month, six-month, or nine-month period of the current fiscal year ended more than 30 days before 						the date of the request and a balance sheet of the corporation as of the end of the period and, in addition, if no annual report for the last fiscal year has been sent to shareholders, the statements referred to in subdivision (a) for the last fiscal year.

(f) In any action or proceeding under this section, if the court finds the failure of the corporation to comply with the requirements of this section to have been without justification, the court may award an amount sufficient to reimburse the shareholder for the reasonable expenses incurred by the shareholder, including attorney’s fees, in connection with 						the action or proceeding.
(g) This section applies to any domestic corporation and also to a foreign corporation having its principal office in California or customarily holding meetings of its board in this state.

(4) Any other person expressly authorized to do so in the articles.
(b) The grounds for involuntary dissolution are that:
(1) The corporation has abandoned its business for more than one year.
(2) The corporation has an even number of directors who are equally divided and cannot agree as to the management of its affairs, so that 				 its business can no longer be conducted to advantage or so that there is danger that its property and business will be impaired or lost, and the holders of the voting shares of the corporation are so divided into factions that they cannot elect a board consisting of an uneven number.
(3) There is internal dissension and two or more factions of shareholders in the corporation are so deadlocked that its business can no longer be conducted with advantage to its shareholders or the shareholders have failed at two consecutive annual meetings at which all voting power was exercised, to elect successors to directors whose terms have expired or would have expired upon election of their successors.
(4) Those in control of the corporation have been guilty of or have knowingly countenanced persistent and pervasive fraud, mismanagement or abuse of authority or persistent unfairness toward any 				 shareholders or its property is being misapplied or wasted by its directors or officers.

1801.
  (a) The Attorney General may bring an action against any domestic corporation or purported domestic corporation in the name of the people of this state, upon the Attorney General’s own information or upon complaint of a private party, to procure a judgment dissolving the corporation and annulling, vacating or forfeiting its corporate existence upon any of the following grounds:
(1) The corporation has seriously offended against any provision of the statutes regulating corporations.
(2) The corporation has fraudulently abused or 				 usurped corporate privileges or powers.
(3) The corporation has violated any provision of law by any act or default which under the law is a ground for forfeiture of corporate existence.

The court also may appoint a receiver for winding up the affairs of the corporation or may order that the corporation be wound up by its board subject to the supervision of the court.
(d) Service of process on the corporation may be made pursuant to Chapter 17 or by written notice to the president or secretary of the corporation at the address indicated in the corporation’s last tax return filed pursuant to the Bank and Corporation Tax Law. The Attorney General shall also publish one time in a newspaper of general circulation in the proper county a notice to the shareholders of the corporation.
(Added by Stats. 1975, Ch. 682.)

The provisions of subdivision (c) of Section 308 apply to any such provisional director so appointed.
(Amended by Stats. 1977, Ch. 235.)
1803.
  If, at the time of the filing of a complaint for involuntary dissolution or at any time thereafter, the court has reasonable grounds to believe that unless a receiver of the corporation is appointed the interests of the corporation and its shareholders will suffer pending the hearing and determination of the complaint, upon the application of the plaintiff, and after a hearing upon such notice to the corporation as the court may direct and upon the giving of security pursuant to Sections 566 and 567 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the court may appoint a receiver to take over and manage the business and affairs of the corporation and to preserve its property pending the 				 hearing and determination of the complaint for dissolution.

(c) When an involuntary proceeding for winding up has commenced, the corporation shall cease to carry on business except to the extent necessary for the beneficial winding up thereof and except during such period as the board may deem necessary to preserve the corporation’s goodwill or going-concern value pending a sale of its business or assets, or both, in whole or in part. The directors shall cause written notice of the commencement of the proceeding for involuntary winding up to be given by mail to all shareholders and to all known creditors and claimants whose addresses appear on the records of the corporation, unless the order for winding up has been stayed by appeal therefrom or otherwise or the proceeding or the execution of the order has been enjoined.
(Added by Stats. 1975, Ch. 682.)
1806.
  When an involuntary proceeding for winding up has been commenced, the jurisdiction of the court includes:

(b) The determination or compromise of all claims of every nature against the corporation or any of its property, and the determination of the amount 				 of money or assets required to be retained to pay or provide for the payment of claims.

(f) The filling of any vacancies on the board which the directors or shareholders are unable to fill.
(g) The removal of any director if it appears that the director has been guilty of dishonesty, misconduct, neglect or abuse of trust in conducting the winding up or if the director is unable to act. The court may order an election to fill the vacancy so caused, and may enjoin, for such time as it considers proper, the reelection of the director so removed; or the court, in lieu of ordering an election, may appoint a director to fill the vacancy caused by such removal. Any director so appointed by the court shall serve until the next annual meeting of shareholders or until a successor is elected or appointed.
(h) Staying the prosecution of any suit, proceeding or action against the corporation and requiring the parties to present and prove their claims in the manner required of other creditors.
(i) The determination of 				 whether adequate provision has been made for payment or satisfaction of all debts and liabilities not actually paid.

If it is shown that a claimant did not receive notice because of absence from the state or other cause, the court may allow a claim to be filed or presented at any time before distribution is completed.
(b) Such notice to creditors shall be published not less than once a week for three consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation published in the county in which the proceeding is pending or, if there is no such newspaper published in that county, in such newspaper as may be designated by the court, directing creditors and claimants to make and present claims and proofs to the person, at the place and within the time specified in the notice. A copy of the notice shall be mailed to each person shown as a creditor or claimant on the books of the corporation, at such person’s last known address.
(c) Holders of secured claims may prove for the whole debt in order to realize any deficiency. If such creditors fail to present their claims they shall be barred only as to any right to claim against the general assets for any deficiency in the amount realized on their security.
(d) Before any distribution is made the amount of any unmatured, contingent or disputed claim against the corporation which has been presented and has not been disallowed, or such part of any such claim as the holder would be entitled to if the claim were due, established or absolute, shall be paid into court and there remain to be paid over to the party when the party becomes entitled thereto or, if the party fails to establish a claim, to be paid over or distributed with the other assets of the corporation to those entitled thereto; or such other provision for the full payment of such claim, if and when established, shall be made as the court may deem adequate. A creditor whose claim has been allowed but is not yet due shall be entitled to its present value upon distribution.

CHAPTER 20. General Provisions Relating to Dissolution [2000 - 2011]  ( Chapter 20 added by Stats. 1975, Ch. 682. )

2000.
  (a) Subject to any contrary provision in the articles, which may include a reference to a separate written agreement between two or more shareholders pertaining to the purchase of shares:
In any suit for involuntary dissolution, or in any proceeding for voluntary dissolution initiated by the vote of shareholders representing only 50 percent of the voting power, the corporation or, if it does not elect to purchase, the holders of 50 percent or more of the voting power of the corporation (the “purchasing parties”) may avoid the dissolution of the corporation and the appointment 						of any receiver by purchasing for cash the shares owned by the plaintiffs or by the shareholders so initiating the proceeding (the “moving parties”) at their fair value.
The fair value shall be determined on the basis of the liquidation value as of the valuation date but taking into account the possibility, if any, of sale of the entire business as a going concern in a liquidation. In fixing the value, the amount of any damages resulting if the initiation of the dissolution is a breach by any moving party or parties of an agreement with the purchasing party or parties may be deducted from the amount payable to the moving party or parties, unless the ground for dissolution is that specified in paragraph (4) of subdivision (b) of Section 1800. The election of the corporation to purchase may be made by the approval of the outstanding shares (Section 152) excluding 						shares held by the moving parties.
(b) If the purchasing parties (1) elect to purchase the shares owned by the moving parties, and (2) are unable to agree with the moving parties upon the fair value of those shares, and (3) give bond with sufficient security to pay the estimated reasonable expenses (including attorneys’ fees) of the moving parties if 						those expenses are recoverable under subdivision (c), the court upon application of the purchasing parties, either in the pending action or in a proceeding initiated in the superior court of the proper county by the purchasing parties in the case of a voluntary election to wind up and dissolve, shall stay the winding up and dissolution proceeding and shall proceed to ascertain and fix the fair value of the shares owned by the moving parties.
(c) The court shall appoint three disinterested appraisers to appraise the fair value of the shares owned by the moving parties, and shall make an order referring the matter to the appraisers so appointed for the purpose of ascertaining the value. The order shall prescribe the time and manner of producing evidence, if evidence is required. The award of the appraisers or of a majority of 						them, when confirmed by the court, shall be final and conclusive upon all parties. The court shall enter a decree, which shall provide in the alternative for winding up and dissolution of the corporation unless payment is made for the shares within the time specified by the decree. If the purchasing parties do not make payment for the shares within the time specified, judgment shall be entered against them and the surety or sureties on the bond for the amount of the expenses (including attorneys’ fees) of the moving parties. Any shareholder aggrieved by the action of the court may appeal the court’s decision.
(d) If the purchasing parties desire to prevent the winding up and dissolution, they shall pay to the moving parties the value of their shares ascertained and decreed within the time specified pursuant to this section, or, in case of an 						appeal, as fixed on appeal. On receiving payment or the tender thereof, the moving parties shall transfer their shares to the purchasing parties.
(e) For the purposes of this section, “shareholder” includes a beneficial owner of shares who has entered into an agreement under Section 300 or 706.
(f) For the purposes of this section, the valuation date shall be (1) in the case of a suit for involuntary dissolution under Section 1800, the date upon which that action was commenced, or (2) in the case of a proceeding for voluntary dissolution initiated by the vote of shareholders representing only 50 percent of the voting power, the date upon which that proceeding was initiated. However, in either case the court may, upon the hearing of a motion by any party, and for good cause 						shown, designate some other date as the valuation date.
(Amended by Stats. 2017, Ch. 721, Sec. 1. (AB 1535) Effective January 1, 2018.)
2001.
  The powers and duties of the directors (or other persons appointed by the court pursuant to Section 1805) and officers after commencement of a dissolution proceeding include, but are not limited to, the following acts in the name and on behalf of the corporation:
(a) To elect officers and to employ agents and attorneys to liquidate or wind up its affairs.
(b) To continue the conduct of the business insofar as necessary for the disposal or winding up thereof.
(c) To carry out 				 contracts and collect, pay, compromise and settle debts and claims for or against the corporation.
(d) To defend suits brought against the corporation.
(e) To sue, in the name of the corporation, for all sums due or owing to the corporation or to recover any of its property.
(f) To collect any amounts remaining unpaid on subscriptions to shares or to recover unlawful distributions.
(g) To sell at public or private sale, exchange, convey or otherwise dispose of all or any part of the assets of the corporation for cash in an amount deemed reasonable by the board without compliance with the provisions of Section 1001 (except subdivision (d) thereof), or (subject to compliance with the provisions of Sections 1001, 1200 and 1201, but Chapter 13 (commencing 				 with Section 1300) shall not be applicable thereto) upon such other terms and conditions and for such other considerations as the board deems reasonable or expedient; and to execute bills of sale and deeds of conveyance in the name of the corporation.
(h) In general, to make contracts and to do any and all things in the name of the corporation which may be proper or convenient for the purposes of winding up, settling and liquidating the affairs of the corporation.

  A vacancy on the board may be filled during a winding up proceeding in the manner provided in Section 305.
(Added by Stats. 1975, Ch. 682.)
2003.
  When the identity of the directors or their right to hold office is in doubt, or if they are dead or unable to act, or they fail or refuse to act or their whereabouts cannot be ascertained, any interested person may petition the superior court of the proper county to determine the identity of the directors or, if there are no directors, to appoint directors to wind up the affairs of the corporation, after hearing upon such notice to such persons as the court may direct.
(Added by Stats. 1975, Ch. 682.)
2004.
  After determining that all the known debts and liabilities of a corporation in the process of winding up have been paid or adequately provided for, the board shall distribute all the remaining corporate assets among the shareholders according to their respective rights and preferences or, if there are no shareholders, to the persons entitled thereto. If the winding up is by court proceeding or subject to court supervision, the distribution shall not be made until after the expiration of any period for the presentation of claims which has been prescribed by order of the court.
(Amended by Stats. 1976, Ch. 641.)
2005.
  The payment of a debt or liability, whether the whereabouts of the creditor is known or unknown, has been adequately provided for if the payment has been provided for by either of the following means:
(a) Payment thereof has been assumed or guaranteed in good faith by one or more financially responsible corporations or other persons or by the United States government or any agency thereof, and the provision (including the financial responsibility of such corporations or other persons) was determined in good faith and with reasonable care by the board to be adequate at the time of any distribution of the assets by 				 the board pursuant to this chapter.
(b) The amount of the debt or liability has been deposited as provided in Section 2008.
This section does not prescribe the exclusive means of making adequate provision for debts and liabilities.
(Added by Stats. 1975, Ch. 682.)
2006.
  Distribution may be made either in money or in property or securities and either in installments from time to time or as a whole, if this can be done fairly and ratably and in conformity with the provisions of the articles and the rights of the shareholders, and shall be made as soon as reasonably consistent with the beneficial liquidation of the corporate assets.
(Added by Stats. 1975, Ch. 682.)
2007.
  (a) If the corporation in process of winding up has both preferred and common shares outstanding, a plan of distribution of the shares, obligations or securities of any other corporation, domestic or foreign, or assets other than money which is not in accordance with the liquidation rights of the preferred shares as specified in the articles may nevertheless be adopted if approved by (1) the board and (2) by approval of the outstanding shares (Section 152) of each class. The plan may provide that such distribution is in complete or partial satisfaction of the rights of any of such shareholders upon distribution and liquidation of the 				 assets.
(b) A plan of distribution so approved shall be binding upon all the shareholders except as provided in subdivision (c). The board shall cause notice of the adoption of the plan to be given by mail within 20 days after its adoption to all holders of shares having a liquidation preference.
(c) Shareholders having a liquidation preference who dissent from the plan of distribution are entitled to be paid the amount of their liquidation preference in cash if they file written demand for payment with the corporation within 30 days after the date of mailing of the notice of the adoption of the plan of distribution, unless the plan of distribution is abandoned. The demand shall state the number and class of the shares held of record by the shareholder in respect of which the shareholder claims payment.
(d) If any 				 such demand for cash payment is filed, the board in its discretion may abandon the plan without further approval by the outstanding shares (Section 152), and all shareholders shall then be entitled to distribution according to their rights and liquidation preferences in the process of winding up.
(e) This section shall not apply to a distribution in accordance with a reorganization the principal terms of which have been approved pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 1202.
(Amended by Stats. 1988, Ch. 919, Sec. 10.)
2008.
  (a) If any shareholders or creditors are unknown or fail or refuse to accept their payment, dividend, or distribution in cash or property or their whereabouts cannot be ascertained after diligent inquiry, or the existence or amount of a claim of a creditor or shareholder is contingent, contested, or not determined, or if the ownership of any shares of stock is in dispute, the corporation may deposit any such payment, dividend, distribution, or the maximum amount of the claim with the Controller in trust for the benefit of those lawfully 				 entitled to the payment, dividend, distribution, or the amount of the claim. The payment, dividend, or distribution shall be paid over by the depositary to the lawful owners, their representatives or assigns, upon satisfactory proof of title.
(b) For the purpose of providing for the transmittal, receipt, accounting for, claiming, management, and investment of all money or other property deposited with the Controller under subdivision (a), the money or other property shall be deemed to be paid or delivered for deposit with the Controller under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 1500) of Title 10 of Part 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and may be recovered in the manner prescribed in that chapter.
(Amended by Stats. 1996, Ch. 860, Sec. 1. Effective January 1, 1997.)
2009.
  (a) Whenever in the process of winding up a corporation any distribution of assets has been made, otherwise than under an order of court, without prior payment or adequate provision for payment of any of the debts and liabilities of the corporation, any amount so improperly distributed to any shareholder may be recovered by the corporation. Any of such shareholders may be joined as defendants in the same action or brought in on the motion of any other defendant.
(b) Suit may be brought in the name of the corporation to enforce the liability under subdivision (a) against any or all 				 shareholders receiving the distribution by any one or more creditors of the corporation, whether or not they have reduced their claims to judgment.
(c) Shareholders who satisfy any liability under this section shall have the right of ratable contribution from other distributees similarly liable. Any shareholder who has been compelled to return to the corporation more than the shareholder’s ratable share of the amount needed to pay the debts and liabilities of the corporation may require that the corporation recover from any or all of the other distributees such proportion of the amounts received by them upon the improper distribution as to give contribution to those held liable under this section and make the distribution of the assets fair and ratable, according to the respective rights and preferences of the shares, after payment or adequate provision for payment of all the debts and liabilities of the corporation.
(d) As used in this section, “process of winding up” includes proceedings under Chapters 18 and 19 and also any other distribution of assets to shareholders made in contemplation of termination or abandonment of the corporate business.
(Added by Stats. 1975, Ch. 682.)
2010.
  (a) A corporation which is dissolved nevertheless continues to exist for the purpose of winding up its affairs, prosecuting and defending actions by or against it and enabling it to collect and discharge obligations, dispose of and convey its property and collect and divide its assets, but not for the purpose of continuing business except so far as necessary for the winding up thereof.
(b) No action or proceeding to which a corporation is a party abates by the dissolution of 				 the corporation or by reason of proceedings for winding up and dissolution thereof.
(c) Any assets inadvertently or otherwise omitted from the winding up continue in the dissolved corporation for the benefit of the persons entitled thereto upon dissolution of the corporation and on realization shall be distributed accordingly.
(Amended by Stats. 2006, Ch. 773, Sec. 12. Effective September 29, 2006.)
2011.
  (a) (1) Causes of action against a dissolved corporation, whether arising before or after the dissolution of the corporation, may be enforced against any of the following:
(A) Against the dissolved corporation, to the extent of its undistributed assets, including, without limitation, any insurance assets held by the corporation that may be available to satisfy claims.
(B) If any of the assets of the dissolved corporation have been distributed to shareholders, against shareholders of the dissolved corporation to the extent of their pro rata share of the claim or to the extent of the corporate assets distributed to them upon dissolution of the 				 corporation, whichever is less.
A shareholder’s total liability under this section may not exceed the total amount of assets of the dissolved corporation distributed to the shareholder upon dissolution of the corporation.
(2) Except as set forth in subdivision (c), all causes of action against a shareholder of a dissolved corporation arising under this section are extinguished unless the claimant commences a proceeding to enforce the cause of action against that shareholder of a dissolved corporation prior to the earlier of the following:
(A) The expiration of the statute of limitations applicable to the cause of action.
(B) Four years after the effective date of the dissolution of the corporation.
(3) As a 				 matter of procedure only, and not for purposes of determining liability, shareholders of the dissolved corporation may be sued in the corporate name of the corporation upon any cause of action against the corporation.

(4) This subdivision applies to corporations dissolved on and after January 1, 1992. Corporations dissolved prior to that date are subject to the law in effect prior to that date.
(b) Summons or other process against such a corporation may be served by delivering a copy thereof to an officer, director, or person having charge of its assets or, if no such person can be found, to any agent upon whom process might be served at the time of 				 dissolution. If none of those persons can be found with due diligence and it is so shown by affidavit to the satisfaction of the court, then the court may make an order that summons or other process be served upon the dissolved corporation by personally delivering a copy thereof, together with a copy of the order, to the Secretary of State or an assistant or deputy secretary of state. Service in this manner is deemed complete on the 10th day after delivery of the process to the Secretary of State.
(c) Every such corporation shall survive and continue to exist indefinitely for the purpose of being sued in any quiet title action. Any judgment rendered in any such action shall bind each and all of its shareholders or other persons having any equity or other interest in that corporation, to the extent of their interest therein, and that action shall have the same force and effect as an action brought under the provisions of Sections 410.50 and 				 410.60 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Service of summons or other process in any such action may be made as provided in Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 413.10) of Title 5 of Part 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure or as provided in subdivision (b).
(d) Upon receipt of that process and the fee therefor, the Secretary of State forthwith shall give notice to the corporation as provided in Section 1702.
(e) For purposes of Article 4 (commencing with Section 19071) of Chapter 4 of Part 10.2 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, the liability described in this section shall be considered a liability at law with respect to a dissolved corporation.

(b) No foreign corporation having a name which would not be available pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 201 to a new corporation organized under this division shall transact 						intrastate business in this state or qualify to do so under this chapter or file an amended statement and designation containing such name unless either: (1) it obtains and files an order from a court of competent jurisdiction permanently enjoining the other corporation having a conflicting name from doing business in this state under that name; or (2) the Secretary of State finds, upon proof by affidavit or otherwise as the Secretary of State may determine, that the business to be conducted in this state by the foreign corporation is not the same as or similar to the business being conducted by the corporation (or to be conducted by the proposed corporation) with whose name it may conflict and that the public is not likely to be deceived, and the foreign corporation agrees that it will transact business in this state under an alternate name disclosed to the Secretary of State and that it will use 						the alternate name in all of its dealings with the Secretary of State and in the conduct of its affairs in this state.

The amended statement shall set forth the name relinquished as well as the new name alternate and there shall be annexed to the amended statement a certificate of an authorized public official of its state or place of incorporation issued within the past six months from the submission of the amended statement for filing in California that the change of name was made in accordance with the laws of that state or place 						of incorporation.

A copy of the statement and designation, or a copy of the latest statement filed pursuant to Section 2117, certified by the Secretary of State, is 				sufficient evidence of the appointment of an agent for the service of process.

Service in this manner is deemed complete on the 10th day after delivery of the process to the Secretary of State.
(b) Upon receipt of the process and order and the fee therefor the Secretary of State forthwith shall give notice to the corporation of the service of the process by forwarding by registered or certified mail, with request for return receipt, a copy of the process and order to the address specified in the order if the corporation has not filed the statement 				required by Section 2105 or to the two stated addresses of the corporation set forth in the latest statement filed pursuant to Section 2105 or 2117, or if only one address is set forth in the latest statement, to the sole stated address of the corporation.

(c) If a foreign corporation that is qualified to transact intrastate business has its right to transact such business forfeited by the Franchise Tax Board pursuant to the Bank and Corporation Tax Law (Part 11 (commencing with Section 23001) of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code), service of process on that corporation may be effected in the manner set forth in Sections 				2110 and 2111, as if the right to transact intrastate business had not been forfeited.
(d) The fact that a corporation ceases to transact intrastate business without filing a certificate of surrender does not revoke the appointment of any agent for the service of process.
(Amended by Stats. 1997, Ch. 187, Sec. 5. Effective January 1, 1998.)
2115.
  (a) A foreign corporation (other than a foreign association or foreign nonprofit corporation but including a foreign parent corporation even though it does not itself transact intrastate business) is subject to the requirements of subdivision (b) commencing on the date specified in subdivision (d) and continuing until the date specified in subdivision (e) if:
(1) The average of the property factor, the payroll factor, and the sales factor (as defined in Sections 25129, 25132, and 25134 of the Revenue and Taxation Code) with respect to it is more than 50 percent during its latest full income year and
(2) more than one-half of 						its outstanding voting securities are held of record by persons having addresses in this state appearing on the books of the corporation on the record date for the latest meeting of shareholders held during its latest full income year or, if no meeting was held during that year, on the last day of the latest full income year. The property factor, payroll factor, and sales factor shall be those used in computing the portion of its income allocable to this state in its franchise tax return or, with respect to corporations the allocation of whose income is governed by special formulas or that are not required to file separate or any tax returns, which would have been so used if they were governed by this three-factor formula. The determination of these factors with respect to any parent corporation shall be made on a consolidated basis, including in a unitary computation (after elimination of intercompany 						transactions) the property, payroll, and sales of the parent and all of its subsidiaries in which it owns directly or indirectly more than 50 percent of the outstanding shares entitled to vote for the election of directors, but deducting a percentage of the property, payroll, and sales of any subsidiary equal to the percentage minority ownership, if any, in the subsidiary. For the purpose of this subdivision, any securities held to the knowledge of the issuer in the names of broker-dealers, nominees for broker-dealers (including clearing corporations), or banks, associations, or other entities holding securities in a nominee name or otherwise on behalf of a beneficial owner (collectively “nominee holders”), shall not be considered outstanding. However, if the foreign corporation requests all nominee holders to certify, with respect to all beneficial owners for whom securities are held, the number of 						shares held for those beneficial owners having addresses (as shown on the records of the nominee holder) in this state and outside of this state, then all shares so certified shall be considered outstanding and held of record by persons having addresses either in this state or outside of this state as so certified, provided that the certification so provided shall be retained with the record of shareholders and made available for inspection and copying in the same manner as is provided in Section 1600 with respect to that record. A current list of beneficial owners of a foreign corporation’s securities provided to the corporation by one or more nominee holders or their agent pursuant to the requirements of Rule 14b-1(b)(3) or 14b-2(b)(3) as adopted on January 6, 1992, promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, shall constitute an acceptable certification with respect to beneficial owners 						for the purposes of this subdivision.

Any party who obtains a final determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that the corporation failed to provide to the party information required to be provided by this subdivision or provided the party information of the kind required to be provided by this subdivision that was incorrect, then the court, in its discretion, shall have the power to include in its judgment recovery by the party from the corporation of all court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in that legal 						proceeding to the extent they relate to obtaining that final determination.

(c) The Secretary of State shall have 30 calendar days after being served with the petition in which to file a written response. The court shall thereafter set the matter for hearing upon the request of the claimant.

(b) (1) The Secretary of State may defend any action on behalf of the fund and shall have recourse to all appropriate means of defense and review, including examination of witnesses and the right to relitigate any issues that are material and relevant in the proceeding against the fund. The claimant’s judgment shall create a rebuttable presumption of the fraud, misrepresentation, or deceit by the 						corporation, which presumption shall affect the burden of producing evidence.
(2) If the civil judgment, arbitration award, or criminal restitution order in the underlying action on which the final judgment in favor of the petitioner was by default, stipulation, consent, or pursuant to Section 594 of the Code of Civil Procedure, or if the action against the corporation or its agent was defended by a trustee in bankruptcy, the petitioner shall have the burden of proving that the cause of action against the corporation or its agent was for fraud, misrepresentation, or deceit.
(c) If the final judgment is a criminal restitution order against an agent, the petitioner shall have the burden of proving that the defendant named in the criminal restitution order qualifies as an agent 						as defined in this chapter. An active corporation, that has submitted a response to the application pursuant to Section 2282.2, may be permitted by the court to appear in the action regarding the sole issue of whether the defendant named in the criminal restitution order qualifies as its agent as defined in this chapter.
(d) The Secretary of State may move the court at any time to dismiss the petition when it appears there are no triable issues and the petition is without merit. The motion may be supported by affidavit of any person or persons having knowledge of the facts, and may be made on the basis that the petition, and the judgment referred to therein, does not form the basis for a meritorious recovery claim within the purview of Section 2282; provided, however, the Secretary of State shall give written notice at least 10 calendar days 						before hearing on the motion to the claimant.
(Amended by Stats. 2016, Ch. 390, Sec. 5. (AB 2759) Effective January 1, 2017.)

(b) When multiple corporations or their agents are involved in the same event or series of events that are the basis of the claimant’s final judgment and the conduct of two or more of the corporations 						or their agents results in a judgment meeting the requirements of Section 2282, the claimant may seek recovery from the fund based on the judgment against any one of the corporations or their agents, subject to the limitations of subdivision (a).
(c) When multiple claimants are involved in a corporate fraud, or in misrepresentation or deceit by a corporation or its agents, resulting in a judgment meeting the requirements of Section 2282, each claimant may seek recovery from the fund individually, 						subject to the limitations of subdivision (a).

2294.

(d) A social purpose corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any of its agents against any liability asserted against or incurred by the agent in that capacity or arising out of the agent’s status as an agent regardless of whether the social purpose corporation would have the power to indemnify the agent against that liability under this section. The fact that a social purpose corporation owns all or a portion of the shares of the company issuing a policy of insurance shall not render this subdivision inapplicable if either of the following conditions are satisfied:
(1) The insurance provided by this subdivision is limited as indemnification is required to be limited by paragraph (11) of subdivision (a) of Section 2603.
(2) (A) The company issuing the insurance policy is 				 organized, licensed, and operated in a manner that complies with the insurance laws and regulations applicable to its jurisdiction of organization.

(C) The policy issued provides for some manner of risk sharing between the issuer and purchaser of the policy, on one hand, and some unaffiliated person or persons, on the other, such as by providing for more than one unaffiliated owner of the company issuing the policy or by providing that a portion of the coverage furnished will be obtained from some unaffiliated insurer or reinsurer.
(e) This section does not apply to any proceeding against any trustee, investment 				 manager, or other fiduciary of an employee benefit plan in that person’s capacity as such, even though the person may also be an agent as defined in subdivision (a) of the employer social purpose corporation.

(d) No action may be instituted or maintained in right of any domestic or foreign social purpose corporation by any holder of shares or of voting trust certificates of the social purpose corporation unless both of the following conditions exist:
(1) The plaintiff alleges in the complaint that plaintiff was a shareholder, of record or beneficially, or the holder of voting trust certificates at the time of the transaction or any part thereof of which plaintiff complains or that plaintiff’s shares or voting trust certificates thereafter devolved upon plaintiff by operation of law from a holder who was a holder at the time of 				 the transaction or any part thereof complained of. Any shareholder who does not meet these requirements may nevertheless be allowed, in the discretion of the court, to maintain the action on a preliminary showing to and determination by the court, by motion and after a hearing, at which the court shall consider the evidence by affidavit or testimony, as it deems material, of all of the following:
(A) There is a strong prima facie case in favor of the claim asserted on behalf of the social purpose corporation.
(B) No other similar action has been or is likely to be instituted.

(e) In any action referred to in subdivision (c), at any time within 30 days after 				 service of summons upon the social purpose corporation or upon any defendant who is an officer or director of the social purpose corporation, or held that office at the time of the acts complained of, the social purpose corporation or the defendant may move the court for an order, upon notice and hearing, requiring the plaintiff to furnish a bond as hereinafter provided. The motion shall be based upon one or both of the following grounds:
(1) There is no reasonable possibility that the prosecution of the cause of action alleged in the complaint against the moving party will benefit the social purpose corporation or its shareholders.
(2) The moving party, if other than the social purpose corporation, did not participate in the transaction complained of in any capacity.
The court on application of the social purpose corporation or any 				 defendant may, for good cause shown, extend the 30-day period for an additional period or periods not exceeding 60 days.
(f) At the hearing upon any motion pursuant to subdivision (d), the court shall consider the evidence, written or oral, by witnesses or affidavit, as may be material to the ground or grounds upon which the motion is based, or to a determination of the probable reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, of the social purpose corporation and the moving party that will be incurred in the defense of the action. If the court determines, after hearing the evidence adduced by the parties, that the moving party has established a probability in support of any of the grounds upon which the motion is based, the court shall fix the amount of the bond, not to exceed fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), to be furnished by the plaintiff for reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, which may be incurred by the moving party and the 				 social purpose corporation in connection with the action, including expenses for which the social purpose corporation may become liable pursuant to Section 2702. A ruling by the court on the motion shall not be a determination of any issue in the action or of the merits thereof. If the court, upon the motion, makes a determination that a bond shall be furnished by the plaintiff as to any one or more defendants, the action shall be dismissed as to the defendant or defendants, unless the bond required by the court has been furnished within such reasonable time as may be fixed by the court.
(g) If the plaintiff, either before or after a motion is made pursuant to subdivision (d), or any order or determination pursuant to the motion, furnishes a bond in the aggregate amount of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) to secure the reasonable expenses of the parties entitled to make the motion, the plaintiff shall be deemed to have complied with the 				 requirements of this section and with any order for a bond theretofore made, and any motion then pending shall be dismissed and no further or additional bond shall be required.
(h) If a motion is filed pursuant to subdivision (d), no pleadings need be filed by the social purpose corporation or any other defendant and the prosecution of the action shall be stayed until 10 days after the motion has been disposed of.

3401.
  (a) The principal terms of a reorganization shall be approved by the outstanding shares of each class of each social purpose corporation the approval of whose board is required under Section 3400, except as provided in subdivision (b) and except that, unless otherwise provided in the articles, no approval of any class of outstanding preferred shares of the surviving or acquiring social purpose corporation or parent party shall be required if the rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions granted to or imposed upon that class of shares remain unchanged, subject to the provisions of subdivision (c). For the purpose of this subdivision, two classes of common shares differing only as to voting rights shall be considered as a single class of shares.
(b) No approval of the outstanding shares is required by subdivision (a) if the social purpose corporation, or its shareholders immediately before the reorganization, or both, shall own, immediately after the reorganization, equity securities, other than any warrant or right to subscribe to or purchase those equity securities, of the surviving or acquiring social purpose corporation or a parent party possessing more than five-sixths of the voting power of the surviving or acquiring social purpose corporation or parent party.

For the purpose of this section, the voting power of a social purpose corporation shall be 				 calculated by assuming the conversion of all equity securities convertible, immediately or at some future time, into shares entitled to vote but not assuming the exercise of any warrant or right to subscribe to or purchase those shares.
(c) Notwithstanding subdivisions (a) and (b), the principal terms of a reorganization shall be approved by the outstanding shares of the surviving social purpose corporation in a merger reorganization, as otherwise required by Chapter 10 (commencing with Section 3400), if any amendment is made to its articles that would otherwise require that approval.
(d) Notwithstanding subdivisions (a) and (b), the principal terms of a reorganization shall be approved by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of each class, or a greater vote if required in the articles, of the outstanding shares of any class of a social purpose corporation that is a party 				 to a merger or sale-of-assets reorganization if holders of shares of that class receive shares of the surviving or acquiring social purpose corporation or parent party having different rights, preferences, privileges, or restrictions than those surrendered. Shares in a foreign corporation received in exchange for shares in a domestic social purpose corporation shall be deemed to have different rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions within the meaning of the preceding sentence.
(e) Notwithstanding subdivisions (a) and (b), the principal terms of a reorganization shall be approved by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of each class, or a greater vote if required in the articles, of the outstanding shares of any social purpose corporation that is a close social purpose corporation if the reorganization would result in the holders receiving shares or other interests of a corporation or other business entity that is not a close 				 social purpose corporation. The articles may provide for a lesser vote, but not less than a majority of the outstanding shares of each class.
(f) Notwithstanding subdivisions (a) and (b), the principal terms of a reorganization shall be approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of each class, or a greater vote if required in the articles, of a social purpose corporation that is a party to a merger reorganization, regardless of whether that class is entitled to vote thereon by the provisions of the articles, if holders of shares of that class receive interests of a surviving other business entity in the merger that is not a social purpose corporation, or receive interests of a surviving social purpose corporation the articles of incorporation of which specify a materially different purpose as part of the reorganization.
(g) Notwithstanding subdivisions (a) 				 and (b), the principal terms of a reorganization shall be approved by all shareholders of any class or series if, as a result of the reorganization, the holders of that class or series become personally liable for any obligations of a party to the reorganization, unless all holders of that class or series have the dissenters’ rights provided in Chapter 13 (commencing with Section 1300) of Division 1.
(h) Any approval required by this section may be given before or after the approval by the board. Notwithstanding approval required by this section, the board may abandon the proposed reorganization without further action by the shareholders, subject to the contractual rights, if any, of third parties.

(l) Section 3500 and Section 3501 apply to any domestic social purpose corporation and also to a foreign social purpose corporation having its principal office in California or customarily holding meetings of its board in this state.

  (a) Upon receipt of any instrument by the Secretary of State for filing pursuant to this part, Part 2, Part 3, Part 4 or Part 5, if it conforms to law, it shall be filed by, and in the office of the Secretary of State and the date of filing endorsed thereon. Except for instruments filed pursuant to Section 6210, 8210, or 9660 the date of filing shall be the date the instrument is received by the Secretary of State unless the instrument provides that it is to be withheld from filing until a future date or unless in the judgment of the Secretary of State the filing is intended to be coordinated with the filing of some other corporate document which cannot be filed. The Secretary of State shall file a document as of any requested future date not more than 90 days after its receipt, including a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, 						if the document is received in the Secretary of State’s office at least one business day prior to the requested date of filing. An instrument does not fail to conform to law because it is not accompanied by the full filing fee if the unpaid portion of such fee does not exceed the limits established by the policy of the Secretary of State for extending credit in such cases.
(b) If the Secretary of State determines that an instrument submitted for filing or otherwise submitted does not conform to law and returns it to the person submitting it, the instrument may be resubmitted accompanied by a written opinion of a member of the State Bar of California submitting the instrument, or representing the person submitting it, to the effect that the specific provision of the instrument objected to by the Secretary of State does conform to law and stating the points and authorities upon which the opinion is based. The Secretary of State shall rely, with 						respect to any disputed point of law (other than the application of Section 5122, 7122, or 9122), upon such written opinion in determining whether the instrument conforms to law. The date of filing in such case shall be the date the instrument is received on resubmission.
(c) Any instrument filed with respect to a corporation (other than original articles) may provide that it is to become effective not more than 90 days subsequent to its filing date. In case such a delayed effective date is specified, the instrument may be prevented from becoming effective by a certificate stating that by appropriate corporate action it has been revoked and is null and void, executed in the same manner as the original instrument and filed before the specified effective date. In the case of a merger agreement, such certificate revoking the earlier filing need only be executed on behalf of one of the constituent corporations. If no such revocation certificate is 						filed, the instrument becomes effective on the date specified.
(d) Any instrument submitted to the Secretary of State for filing pursuant to this part, Part 2, Part 3, Part 4, or Part 5 by a domestic corporation or foreign corporation that is qualified to transact business in California under Section 2105 shall include the entity name and number as they exist on the Secretary of State’s records.

Thereafter, if the amount has not been paid by cashier’s check or equivalent before the date of cancellation as stated in the 						written notice of cancellation, the cancellation shall thereupon be effective.

(c) If the 60-day period expires without the delinquent corporation filing the required statement, the Secretary of State shall notify the Franchise Tax Board of the suspension, and provide a notice of the suspension to the corporation.

(d) A statement required by Section 6210, 8210, or 9660 may be filed, notwithstanding suspension of the corporate powers, rights, and privileges under this section or under 						provisions of the Revenue and Taxation Code. Upon the filing of a statement under Section 6210, 8210, or 9660, by a corporation that has suffered suspension under this section, the Secretary of State shall certify that fact to the Franchise Tax Board and the corporation may thereupon be relieved from suspension, unless the corporation is held in suspension by the Franchise Tax Board because of Section 23301, 23301.5, or 23775 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.

  (a) The Legislature finds and declares that the services of directors and officers of nonprofit corporations who serve without compensation are critical to the efficient conduct and management of the public service and charitable affairs of the people of California. The willingness of volunteers to offer their services has been deterred by a perception that their personal assets are at risk for these activities. The unavailability and unaffordability of appropriate liability insurance makes it difficult for these corporations to protect the personal assets of their volunteer decisionmakers with adequate insurance. It is the public policy of this state to provide incentive and protection to the individuals who perform these important functions.
(b) Except as provided in this section, no cause of action for monetary damages shall arise against any person serving without compensation as a director or officer of a nonprofit corporation subject to Part 2 (commencing with Section 5110), Part 3 (commencing with Section 7110), or Part 4 (commencing with Section 9110) of this division on account of any negligent act or omission occurring (1) within the scope of that person’s duties as a director acting as a board member, or within the scope of that person’s duties as an officer acting in an official capacity; (2) in good faith; (3) in a manner that the person believes to be in the best interest of the corporation; and (4) is in the exercise of his or her policymaking judgment.
(c) This section shall not limit the liability of a director or officer for any of the following:
(1) Self-dealing transactions, as described in Sections 5233 and 9243.
(2) Conflicts of interest, as described in Section 7233.
(3) Actions described in Sections 5237, 7236, and 9245.

(7) Any action brought under Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 16700) of Part 2 of Division 7 of the Business and Professions Code.

(e) This section applies only if the nonprofit corporation maintains a liability insurance policy with an amount of coverage of at least the following amounts:
(1) If the corporation’s annual budget is less than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), the minimum required amount is five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000).
(2) If the corporation’s annual budget equals or exceeds fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), the minimum required amount is one million dollars ($1,000,000).
This section applies only if the claim against the director or officer can also be made directly against the corporation and a liability insurance policy is applicable to the claim. If that policy is found to cover the damages caused by the director or officer, no cause of action as provided in this section shall be maintained against the director or officer.
(f) For the purposes of this section, the payment of actual expenses incurred in attending meetings or otherwise in the execution of the duties of a director or officer shall not constitute compensation.
(g) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the liability of a nonprofit corporation for any negligent act or omission of a director, officer, employee, agent, or servant occurring within the scope of his or her duties.
(h) This section does not apply to any corporation that unlawfully restricts membership, services, or benefits conferred on the basis of political affiliation, age, or any characteristic listed or defined in subdivision (b) or (e) of Section 51 of the Civil Code.
(i) This section does not apply to any volunteer director or officer who receives compensation from the corporation in any other capacity, including, but not limited to, as an employee.

The number or minimum number of directors may be one or more.

ARTICLE 1. General Provisions [5210 - 5215]  ( Article 1 added by Stats. 1978, Ch. 567. )

5210.
  Each corporation shall have a board of directors. Subject to the provisions of this part and any limitations in the articles or bylaws relating to action required to be approved by the members (Section 5034), or by a majority of all members (Section 5033), the activities and affairs of a corporation shall be conducted and all corporate powers shall be exercised by or under the direction of the board. The board may delegate the management of the activities of the corporation to any person or persons, management company, or committee however composed, provided that the activities and affairs of the corporation shall be managed and all corporate powers shall be exercised under the ultimate direction of the board.
(Amended by Stats. 1996, Ch. 589, Sec. 4. Effective January 1, 1997.)
5211.
  (a) Unless otherwise provided in the articles or in the bylaws, all of the following apply:
(1) Meetings of the board may be called by the chair of the board or the president or any vice president or the secretary or any two directors.
(2) Regular meetings of the board may be held without notice if the time and place of the meetings are fixed by the bylaws or the board. Special meetings of the board shall be held upon four days’ notice by first-class mail or 48 hours’ notice delivered personally or by telephone, including a voice messaging system or by electronic transmission by the corporation (Section 20). The articles or bylaws may not dispense with notice of a special meeting. A notice, or waiver of 				 notice, need not specify the purpose of any regular or special meeting of the board.
(3) Notice of a meeting need not be given to a director who provides a waiver of notice or consent to holding the meeting or an approval of the minutes thereof in writing, whether before or after the meeting, or who attends the meeting without protesting, prior thereto or at its commencement, the lack of notice to that director. These waivers, consents, and approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meetings.
(4) A majority of the directors present, whether or not a quorum is present, may adjourn any meeting to another time and place. If the meeting is adjourned for more than 24 hours, notice of an adjournment to another time or place shall be given prior to the time of the adjourned meeting to the directors who were not present at the time of the 				 adjournment.
(5) Meetings of the board may be held at a place within or without the state that has been designated in the notice of the meeting or, if not stated in the notice or there is no notice, designated in the bylaws or by resolution of the board.
(6) Directors may participate in a meeting through use of conference telephone, electronic video screen communication, or electronic transmission by and to the corporation (Sections 20 and 21). Participation in a meeting through use of conference telephone or electronic video screen communication pursuant to this subdivision constitutes presence in person at that meeting as long as all directors participating in the meeting are able to hear one another. Participation in a meeting through use of electronic transmission by and to the corporation, other than conference telephone and electronic video screen communication, pursuant to 				 this subdivision constitutes presence in person at that meeting if both of the following apply:
(A) Each director participating in the meeting can communicate with all of the other directors concurrently.
(B) Each director is provided the means of participating in all matters before the board, including, without limitation, the capacity to propose, or to interpose an objection to, a specific action to be taken by the corporation.
(7) A majority of the number of directors authorized in or pursuant to the articles or bylaws constitutes a quorum of the board for the transaction of business. The articles or bylaws may require the presence of one or more specified directors in order to constitute a quorum of the board to transact business, as long as the death or nonexistence of a specified director or the death or 				 nonexistence of the person or persons otherwise authorized to appoint or designate that director does not prevent the corporation from transacting business in the normal course of events. The articles or bylaws may not provide that a quorum shall be less than one-fifth the number of directors authorized in or pursuant to the articles or bylaws, or less than two, whichever is larger, unless the number of directors authorized in or pursuant to the articles or bylaws is one, in which case one director constitutes a quorum.
(8) Subject to the provisions of Sections 5212, 5233, 5234, 5235, and subdivision (e) of Section 5238, an act or decision done or made by a majority of the directors present at a meeting duly held at which a quorum is present is the act of the board. The articles or bylaws may not provide that a lesser vote than a majority of the directors present at a meeting is the act of the board. A meeting at which a quorum is initially 				 present may continue to transact business notwithstanding the withdrawal of directors, if any action taken is approved by at least a majority of the required quorum for that meeting, or a greater number required by this division, the articles, or the bylaws.
(b) An action required or permitted to be taken by the board may be taken without a meeting if all directors individually or collectively consent in writing to that action and if, subject to subdivision (a) of Section 5224, the number of directors then in office constitutes a quorum. The written consent or consents shall be filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the board. The action by written consent shall have the same force and effect as a unanimous vote of the directors. For purposes of this subdivision only, “all directors” does not include an “interested director” as defined in subdivision (a) of Section 5233 or a “common director” as described in Section 5234 who abstains in 				 writing from providing consent, if (1) the facts described in paragraph (2) or (3) of subdivision (d) of Section 5233 are established or the provisions of paragraph (1) or (2) of subdivision (a) of Section 5234 are satisfied, as appropriate, at or prior to execution of the written consent or consents; (2) the establishment of those facts or satisfaction of those provisions, as applicable, is included in the written consent or consents executed by the noninterested or noncommon directors or in other records of the corporation; and (3) the noninterested or noncommon directors, as applicable, approve the action by a vote that is sufficient without counting the votes of the interested directors or common directors.
(c) Each director shall have one vote on each matter presented to the board of directors for action. A director shall not vote by proxy.
(d) The provisions of this section 				 apply also to incorporators, to committees of the board, and to action by those incorporators or committees mutatis mutandis.
(Amended by Stats. 2019, Ch. 497, Sec. 32. (AB 991) Effective January 1, 2020.)
5212.
  (a) The board may, by resolution adopted by a majority of the number of directors then in office, provided that a quorum is present, create one or more committees, each consisting of two or more directors, to serve at the pleasure of the board. Appointments to such committees shall be by a majority vote of the directors then in office, unless the articles or bylaws require a majority vote of the number of directors authorized in or pursuant to the articles or bylaws. The bylaws may authorize one or more such committees, each consisting of two or more directors, and may provide that a specified officer or officers who are also directors of the corporation shall be a member or members of such committee or committees. The board may appoint one or more directors as alternate members of such 				 committee, who may replace any absent member at any meeting of the committee. Such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the board or in the bylaws, shall have all the authority of the board, except with respect to:
(1) The approval of any action for which this part also requires approval of the members (Section 5034) or approval of a majority of all members (Section 5033), regardless of whether the corporation has members.
(2) The filling of vacancies on the board or in any committee which has the authority of the board.
(3) The fixing of compensation of the directors for serving on the board or on any committee.
(4) The amendment or repeal of bylaws or the adoption of new bylaws.

(6) The appointment of committees of the board or the members thereof.
(7) The expenditure of corporate funds to support a nominee for director after there are more people nominated for director than can be elected.
(8) The approval of any self-dealing transaction except as provided in paragraph (3) of subdivision (d) of Section 5233.
(b)  A committee exercising the authority of the board shall not include as members persons who are not directors. However, the board may create other committees that do not exercise the authority of the board and these other committees may include persons regardless of whether they are 				 directors.
(c) Unless the bylaws otherwise provide, the board may delegate to any committee powers as authorized by Section 5210, but may not delegate the powers set forth in paragraphs (1) to (8), inclusive, of subdivision (a).
(d) If required by subdivision (e) of Section 12586 of the Government Code, the board shall appoint an audit committee in accordance with that subdivision and for the purposes set forth therein.
(Amended by Stats. 2011, Ch. 442, Sec. 3. (AB 1211) Effective January 1, 2012.)
5213.
  (a) A corporation shall have (1) a chair of the board, who may be given the title chair, chairperson, chair of the board, or chairperson of the board, or a president or both, (2) a secretary, (3) a treasurer or a chief financial officer or both, and (4) any other officers with any titles and duties as shall be stated in the bylaws or determined by the board and as may be necessary to enable it to sign instruments. The president, or if there is no president the chair of the board, is the general manager and chief executive officer of the corporation, unless otherwise provided in the articles or bylaws. Unless otherwise specified in the articles or the bylaws, if there is no chief financial officer, the treasurer is the chief financial officer 						of the corporation. Any number of offices may be held by the same person unless the articles or bylaws provide otherwise, except that no person serving as the secretary, the treasurer, or the chief financial officer may serve concurrently as the president or chair of the board. Any compensation of the president or chief executive officer and the chief financial officer or treasurer shall be determined in accordance with subdivision (g) of Section 12586 of the Government Code, if applicable.
(b) Except as otherwise provided by the articles or bylaws, officers shall be chosen by the board and serve at the pleasure of the board, subject to the rights, if any, of an officer under any contract of employment. Any officer may resign at any time upon written notice to the corporation without prejudice to the rights, if any, of the corporation under any 						contract to which the officer is a party.
(c) If the articles or bylaws provide for the election of any officers by the members, the term of office of the elected officer shall be one year unless the articles or bylaws provide for a different term which shall not exceed three years.
(Amended by Stats. 2022, Ch. 617, Sec. 47. (SB 1202) Effective January 1, 2023.)
5214.
  Subject to the provisions of subdivision (a) of Section 5141 and Section 5142, any note, mortgage, evidence of indebtedness, contract, conveyance or other instrument in writing, and any assignment or endorsement thereof, executed or entered into between any corporation and any other person, when signed by any one of the chairperson of the board, the president or any vice president and by any one of the secretary, any assistant secretary, the chief financial officer or any assistant treasurer of such corporation, is not invalidated as to the corporation by any lack of authority of the signing officers in the absence of actual knowledge on the part of the other person that the signing officers had no authority to execute the 						same.
(Amended by Stats. 2022, Ch. 617, Sec. 48. (SB 1202) Effective January 1, 2023.)
5215.
  The original or a copy in writing or in any other form capable of being converted into clearly legible tangible form of the bylaws or of the minutes of any incorporators’, members’, directors’, committee or other meeting or of any resolution adopted by the board or a committee thereof, or members, certified to be a true copy by a person purporting to be the secretary or an assistant secretary of the corporation, is prima facie evidence of the adoption of such bylaws or resolution or of the due holding of such meeting and of the matters stated therein.
(Amended by Stats. 2004, Ch. 254, Sec. 15. Effective January 1, 2005.)
ARTICLE 2. Selection, Removal and Resignation of Directors [5220 - 5227]  ( Article 2 added by Stats. 1978, Ch. 567. )

5220.
  (a) Except as provided in subdivision (d), (e), or (f), directors shall be elected for terms of not longer than four years, as fixed in the articles or bylaws. However, the terms of directors of a corporation without members may be up to six years. In the absence of any provision in the articles or bylaws, the term shall be one year. The articles or bylaws may provide for staggering the terms of directors by dividing the total number of directors into groups of one or more directors. The terms of office of the several groups and the number of directors in each group need not be uniform. An amendment of the articles or bylaws may not extend the term of a director beyond that for which the director was elected, and any bylaw provision increasing 						the terms of directors may not be adopted without approval of the members (Section 5034).
(b) Unless otherwise provided in the articles or bylaws, each director, including a director elected to fill a vacancy, shall hold office until the expiration of the term for which elected and until a successor has been elected and qualified, unless the director has been removed from office.
(c) The articles or bylaws may provide for the election of one or more directors by the members of any class voting as a class.
(d) For the purposes of this subdivision, “designator” means one or more designators. Notwithstanding subdivisions (a) to (c), inclusive, all or any portion of the directors authorized in the articles or bylaws of 						a corporation may hold office by virtue of designation or selection by a specified designator as provided by the articles or bylaws rather than by election. Those directors shall continue in office for the term prescribed by the governing article or bylaw provision, or, if there is no term prescribed, until the governing article or bylaw provision is duly amended or repealed, except as provided in subdivision (e) of Section 5222. A bylaw provision authorized by this subdivision may be adopted, amended, or repealed only by approval of the members (Section 5034) except as provided in subdivision (d) of Section 5150. Unless otherwise provided in the articles or bylaws, the entitlement to designate or select a director or directors shall cease if any of the following circumstances exist:
(1) The specified designator of that director or directors 						has died or ceased to exist.
(2) If the entitlement of the specified designator of that director or directors to designate is in the capacity of an officer, trustee, or other status and the office, trust, or status has ceased to exist.
(e) If a corporation has not issued memberships and (1) all the directors resign, die, or become incompetent, or (2) a corporation’s initial directors have not been named in the articles and all incorporators resign, die, or become incompetent before the election of the initial directors, the superior court of any county may appoint directors of the corporation upon application by any party in interest.
(f) If authorized in the articles or bylaws of a corporation, all or any portion 						of the directors may hold office ex officio by virtue of occupying a specified position within the corporation or outside the corporation. The term of office of an ex officio director shall coincide with that director’s respective term of office in the specified position entitling him or her to serve on the board of directors. Upon an ex officio director’s resignation or removal from that position, or resignation or removal from the board for any reason, the term of office as a director of the corporation shall immediately cease. At that time, the successor in office shall become an ex officio director of the corporation, occupying the place of the former director.
(Amended by Stats. 2018, Ch. 322, Sec. 2. (AB 2557) Effective January 1, 2019.)
5221.
  (a) The board may declare vacant the office of a director who has been declared of unsound mind by a final order of court, or convicted of a felony, or been found by a final order or judgment of any court to have breached any duty under Article 3 (commencing with Section 5230), or, if at the time a director is elected, the bylaws provide that a director may be removed for missing a specified number of board meetings, fails to attend the specified number of meetings.
(b) As provided in paragraph (3) of subdivision (c) of Section 5151, the articles or bylaws may prescribe the qualifications of directors. The board, by a majority vote of the directors who meet all of the required qualifications to be a director, may declare vacant the office of any director who fails or ceases to meet any required qualification that was in effect at the beginning of that director’s current term of office.
(Amended by Stats. 1996, Ch. 589, Sec. 7. Effective January 1, 1997.)

(2) In a corporation with 50 or more members, the removal is approved by the members (Section 5034).
(3) In a corporation with no members, the removal is approved by a majority of the directors then in office.
(b) Except for a corporation having no members pursuant to Section 5310:
(1) In a corporation in which the articles or bylaws authorize members to cumulate their votes pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 5616, no director may be removed (unless the entire board is removed) if the votes cast against removal, or not consenting in writing to the removal, would be sufficient to elect the director if voted cumulatively at an election at which the same total number of votes were cast (or, if the action is taken by written ballot, all memberships entitled to vote were voted) and the entire number of directors authorized at the time of the director’s most recent election were then being elected.
(2) If by the provisions of the articles or bylaws the members of any class, voting as a class, are entitled to elect one or more directors, any director so elected may be removed only by the applicable vote of the members of that class.
(3) If by the provisions of the articles or bylaws the members within a chapter or other organizational unit, or region or other geographic grouping, voting as such, are entitled to elect one or more directors, any director so elected may be removed only by the applicable vote of the members within the organizational unit or geographic grouping.
(c) Any reduction of the authorized number of directors or any amendment reducing the number of classes of directors does not remove any director prior to the expiration of the director’s term of office unless the reduction or any amendment also provides for the removal of one or more specified directors.
(d) Except as provided in this section and Sections 5221, 5223, and 5227, a director may not be removed prior to the expiration of the director’s term of office.
(e) If a director removed under this section, Section 5221, Section 5223, or Section 5227 was chosen by designation pursuant to subdivision (d) of Section 5220, then:
(1) If a different person may be designated pursuant to a governing article or bylaw provision, the new designation shall be made.
(2) If the governing article or bylaw provision contains no provision under which a different person may be designated, the governing article or bylaw provision shall be deemed repealed.
(f) For the purposes of this subdivision, “designator” means one or more designators. If by the provisions of the articles or bylaws a designator is entitled to designate one or more directors, then:
(1) Unless 				 otherwise provided in the articles or bylaws at the time of designation, any director so designated may be removed without cause by the designator of that director.
(2) Any director so designated may only be removed under subdivision (a) with the written consent of the designator of that director.
(3) Unless otherwise provided in the articles or bylaws, the right to remove shall not apply if any of the following circumstances exist:
(A) The designator entitled to that right has died or ceased to exist.
(B) If that right is in the capacity of an officer, trustee, or other status, and the office, trust, or status has ceased to exist.
(Amended by Stats. 2011, Ch. 442, Sec. 5. (AB 1211) Effective January 1, 2012.)
5223.
  (a) The superior court of the proper county may, at the suit of a director, or twice the authorized number (Section 5036) of members or 20 members, whichever is less, remove from office any director in case of fraudulent or dishonest acts or gross abuse of authority or discretion with reference to the corporation or breach of any duty arising under Article 3 (commencing with Section 5230) of this chapter, and may bar from reelection any director so removed for a period prescribed by the court. The corporation shall be made a party to such action.
(b) The Attorney General may bring an action under subdivision (a), may intervene in such an action brought by any other party and shall be given notice of any such action brought by any other party.
(Amended by Stats. 1981, Ch. 587, Sec. 6.)
5224.
  (a) Unless otherwise provided in the articles or bylaws and except for a vacancy created by the removal of a director, vacancies on the board may be filled by approval of the board (Section 5032) or, if the number of directors then in office is less than a quorum, by (1) the unanimous written consent of the directors then in office, (2) the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office at a meeting held pursuant to notice or waivers of notice complying with Section 5211, or (3) a sole remaining director. Unless the articles or a bylaw approved by the members (Section 5034) provide that the board may fill vacancies occurring in the board by reason of the removal of directors, or unless the 						corporation has no members pursuant to Section 5310, such vacancies may be filled only by approval of the members (Section 5034).
(b) The members may elect a director at any time to fill any vacancy not filled by the directors.
(c) Any director may resign effective upon giving written notice to the chairperson of the board, the president, the secretary or the board of directors of the corporation, unless the notice specifies a later time for the effectiveness of such resignation. If the resignation is effective at a future time, a successor may be elected to take office when the resignation becomes effective.
(Amended by Stats. 2022, Ch. 617, Sec. 49. (SB 1202) Effective January 1, 2023.)
5225.
  (a) If a corporation has an even number of directors who are equally divided and cannot agree as to the management of its affairs, so that its activities can no longer be conducted to advantage or so that there is danger that its property, activities, or business will be impaired or lost, the superior court of the proper county may, notwithstanding any provisions of the articles or bylaws and whether or not an action is pending for an involuntary winding up or dissolution of the corporation, appoint a provisional director pursuant to this section. Action for such appointment may be brought by any director or by members holding not less than 331/3 percent of the voting power.
(b) If the members of a corporation are deadlocked so that they cannot elect the directors to be elected at the time prescribed therefor, the superior court of the proper county may, notwithstanding any provisions of the articles or bylaws, upon petition of members holding 50 percent of the voting power, appoint a provisional director or directors pursuant to this section or order such other equitable relief as the court deems appropriate.
(c) Any person bringing an action under subdivision (a) or (b) shall give notice to the Attorney General, who may intervene.
(d) The Attorney General may bring an action under subdivision (a) or (b).

A provisional director shall have all the rights and powers of a director until the deadlock in the board or among members is broken or until such provisional director is removed by order of the court or by approval of a majority of all members (Section 5033). Such person shall be entitled to such compensation as shall be fixed by the court unless otherwise agreed with the corporation.
(Amended by Stats. 1995, Ch. 154, Sec. 12. Effective January 1, 1996.)
5226.

5235.
  (a) The board may fix the compensation of a director, as director or officer, and no obligation, otherwise valid, to pay such compensation shall be voidable merely because the persons receiving the compensation participated in the decision to pay it, unless it was not just and reasonable as to the corporation at the time it was authorized, ratified or approved.

(c) When repayment of a loan, entered into under subdivision (b), to a corporation is secured by only the policy’s death benefit, the contract between the corporation and director or officer that secures the loan shall include terms sufficient to ensure that any policy fees and charges, withdrawals of the cash value, or loans 						taken against it do not impair the value of the death benefit to repay the cost of the loan, for the life of the policy.
(d) When repayment of a loan, entered into under subdivision (b), to a corporation is secured by only the policy’s cash surrender value, the contract between the corporation and the director or officer that secures the loan shall include terms sufficient to ensure that the cash surrender value is sufficient to repay the cost of the loan, for the life of the policy.

(Amended by Stats. 1999, Ch. 453, Sec. 2. Effective January 1, 2000.)
5238.
  (a) For the purposes of this section, “agent” means any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or other agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or was a director, officer, employee or agent of a foreign or domestic corporation that was a predecessor corporation of the corporation or of another enterprise at the request of 				 the predecessor corporation; “proceeding” means any threatened, pending or completed action or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative; and “expenses” includes without limitation attorneys’ fees and any expenses of establishing a right to indemnification under subdivision (d) or paragraph (3) of subdivision (e).
(b) A corporation shall have power to indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any proceeding (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor, an action brought under Section 5233, or an action brought by the Attorney General or a person granted relator status by the Attorney General for any breach of duty relating to assets held in charitable trust) by reason of the fact that 				 the person is or was an agent of the corporation, against expenses, judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with the proceeding if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the corporation and, in the case of a criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the 				 conduct of 				 the person was unlawful. The termination of any proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which the person reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the corporation or that the person had reasonable cause to believe that the person’s conduct was unlawful.
(c) A corporation shall have power to indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action by or in the right of the corporation, or brought under Section 5233, or brought by the Attorney General or a person granted relator status by the Attorney General for breach of duty relating to assets held in charitable trust, to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that 				 the person is or was an agent of the corporation, against expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with the defense or settlement of the action if the person acted in good faith, in a manner 				 the person believed to be in the best interests of the corporation and with such care, including reasonable inquiry, as an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances. No indemnification shall be made under this subdivision:
(1) In respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which the person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation in the performance of the person’s duty to the corporation, unless and only to the extent that the court in which 				 the proceeding is or was pending shall determine upon application that, in view of all the circumstances of the case, 				 the 				 person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for the expenses which the court shall determine;
(2) Of amounts paid in settling or otherwise disposing of a threatened or pending action, with or without court approval; or
(3) Of expenses incurred in defending a threatened or pending action which is settled or otherwise disposed of without court approval unless it is settled with the approval of the Attorney General.
(d) To the extent that an agent of a corporation has been successful on the merits in defense of any proceeding referred to in subdivision (b) or (c) or in defense of any claim, issue or 				 matter therein, the agent shall be indemnified against expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the agent in connection therewith.
(e) Except as provided in subdivision (d), any indemnification under this section shall be made by the corporation only if authorized in the specific case, upon a determination that indemnification of the agent is proper in the circumstances because the agent has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in subdivision (b) or (c), by:
(1) A majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who are not parties to the proceeding;
(2) Approval of the members (Section 5034), with the 				 persons to be indemnified not being entitled to vote thereon; or
(3) The court in which the proceeding is or was pending upon application made by the corporation or the agent or the attorney or other person rendering services in connection with the defense, whether or not the application by the agent, attorney, or other person is opposed by the corporation.
(f) Expenses incurred in 				 defending any proceeding may be advanced by the corporation prior to the final disposition of the 				 proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the agent to repay the amount unless it shall be determined ultimately that the agent is entitled to be indemnified as authorized in this section. The provisions of subdivision (a) of Section 5236 do not apply to advances made pursuant to this subdivision.
(g) No provision made by a corporation to indemnify its or its subsidiary’s directors or officers for the defense of any proceeding, whether contained in the articles, bylaws, a resolution of members or directors, an agreement or otherwise, shall be valid unless consistent with this section. Nothing contained in this section shall affect any right to indemnification to which persons other than 				 the directors and officers may be entitled by contract or otherwise.
(h) No indemnification or advance shall be made under this section, except as provided in subdivision (d) or paragraph (3) of subdivision (e), in any circumstance where it appears:
(1) That it would be inconsistent with a provision of the articles, bylaws, a resolution of the members or an agreement in effect at the time of the accrual of the alleged cause of action asserted in the proceeding in which the expenses were incurred or other amounts were paid, which prohibits or otherwise limits indemnification; or
(2) That it would be inconsistent with any condition expressly imposed by a court in approving a settlement.
(i) A corporation shall have 				 power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any agent of the corporation against any liability asserted against or incurred by the agent in such capacity or arising out of the agent’s status as such whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify the agent against 				 that liability under the provisions of this section; provided, however, that a corporation shall have no power to purchase and maintain that insurance to indemnify any agent of the corporation for a violation of Section 5233.
(j) This section does not apply to any proceeding against any trustee, investment manager, or other fiduciary of a pension, deferred compensation, saving, thrift, or other retirement, incentive, 				 or benefit plan, trust, or provision for any or all of the corporation’s directors, officers, employees, and persons providing services to the corporation or any of its subsidiary or related or affiliated corporations, in that person’s capacity as such, even though the person may also be an agent as defined in subdivision (a) of the employer corporation. A corporation shall have power to indemnify the 				 trustee, investment manager or other fiduciary to the extent permitted by subdivision (f) of Section 				 5140.
(Amended by Stats. 2012, Ch. 61, Sec. 1. (AB 2668) Effective January 1, 2013.)
5239.
  (a) There shall be no personal liability to a third party for monetary damages on the part of a volunteer director or volunteer executive officer of a nonprofit corporation subject to this part, caused by the director’s or officer’s negligent act or omission in the performance of that person’s duties as a director or officer, if all of the following conditions are met:
(1) The act or omission was within the scope of the director’s or executive officer’s duties.
(2) The act or omission was performed in good faith.
(3) The act or omission was not reckless, wanton, intentional, or grossly negligent.
(4) Damages caused by the act or omission are covered pursuant to a liability insurance policy issued to the corporation, either in the form of a general liability policy or a director’s and officer’s liability policy, or personally to the director or executive officer. In the event that the damages are not covered by a liability insurance policy, the volunteer director or volunteer executive officer shall not be personally liable for the damages if the board of directors of the corporation and the person had made all reasonable efforts in good faith to obtain available liability insurance.
(b) “Volunteer” means the rendering of services without compensation. “Compensation” means remuneration whether by way of salary, fee, or other consideration for services rendered. However, the payment of per diem, mileage, or other reimbursement expenses to a director or executive officer does not affect that person’s status as a volunteer within the meaning of this section.
(c) “Executive officer” means the president, vice president, secretary, or treasurer of a corporation, or such other individual who serves in like capacity, who assists in establishing the policy of the corporation.
(d) Nothing in this section shall limit the liability of the corporation for any damages caused by acts or omissions of the volunteer director or volunteer executive officer.

(1) As provided in Section 5233 or 5237.
(2) In any action or proceeding brought by the Attorney General.

(h) As used in this section as applied to nonprofit public benefit corporations which have an annual budget of less than twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) and that are exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, the condition of making “all reasonable efforts in good faith to obtain available liability insurance” shall be satisfied by the corporation if it makes at least one inquiry per year to purchase a general liability insurance policy and that insurance was not available at a cost of less than 5 percent of the previous year’s annual budget of the corporation. If the corporation is in its first year of operation, this subdivision shall apply for as long as the budget of the corporation does not exceed twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) in its first year of operation.
An inquiry pursuant to this subdivision shall obtain premium costs for a general liability policy with an amount of coverage of at least five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000).

(b) Except as provided in subdivision (c), in investing, reinvesting, purchasing, acquiring, exchanging, selling and managing the corporation’s investments, the board shall do the following:
(1) Avoid speculation, looking instead to the permanent disposition of the funds, considering the probable income, as well as the probable safety of the corporation’s capital.
(2) Comply with additional standards, if any, imposed by the articles, bylaws or express terms of an instrument or agreement pursuant to which the assets were contributed to the corporation.

(d) In carrying out duties under this section, each director shall act as required by subdivision (a) of Section 5231, may rely upon others as permitted by subdivision (b) of Section 5231, and shall have the benefit of subdivision (c) of Section 5231, and the board may 				 delegate its investment powers as permitted by Section 5210.
(e) Compliance with the Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act (Part 7 (commencing with Section 18501) of Division 9 of the Probate Code), if that act would be applicable, will be deemed to be compliance with subdivision (b).
(Amended by Stats. 2015, Ch. 56, Sec. 1. (AB 792) Effective January 1, 2016.)
5241.
  Nothing in Section 5240 shall abrogate or restrict the power of the appropriate court in proper cases to direct or permit a corporation to deviate from the terms of a trust or agreement regarding the making or retention of investments.

  A corporation may issue memberships having different rights, privileges, preferences, restrictions or conditions, as authorized by its articles or bylaws.
(Amended by Stats. 1979, Ch. 724.)
5331.
  Except as provided in or authorized by the articles or bylaws, all memberships shall have the same rights, privileges, preferences, restrictions and conditions.
(Amended by Stats. 1979, Ch. 724.)
5332.
  (a) A corporation may refer to persons associated with it as “members” even though such persons are not members within the meaning of Section 5056; but references to members in this part mean members as defined in Section 5056.
(b) A corporation may benefit, serve, or assist persons who are not members within the meaning of Section 5056 for such consideration, if any, as the board may determine or as is authorized or provided for in the articles or bylaws.
(Amended by Stats. 1979, Ch. 724.)
ARTICLE 4. Termination of Memberships [5340 - 5342]  ( Article 4 added by Stats. 1978, Ch. 567. )

5340.
  (a) A member may resign from membership at any time.
(b) This section shall not relieve the resigning member from any obligation for charges incurred, services or benefits actually rendered, dues, assessments or fees, or arising from contract or otherwise, and this section shall not diminish any right of the corporation to enforce any such obligation or obtain damages for its breach.
(c) A membership issued for a period of time shall expire when such period of time has elapsed unless the membership is renewed.
(Amended by Stats. 1979, Ch. 724.)
5341.
  (a) No member may be expelled or suspended, and no membership or membership rights may be terminated or suspended, except according to procedures satisfying the requirements of this section. An expulsion, termination or suspension not in accord with this section shall be void and without effect.
(b) Any expulsion, suspension or termination must be done in good faith and in a fair and reasonable manner. Any procedure which conforms to the requirements of subdivision (c) is fair and reasonable, but a court may also find other procedures to be fair and reasonable when the full circumstances of the suspension, termination, or expulsion are considered.
(c) A procedure is fair and reasonable when:
(1) The provisions of the procedure have been set forth in the articles or bylaws, or copies of such provisions are sent annually to all the members as required by the articles or bylaws;
(2) It provides the giving of 15 days prior notice of the expulsion, suspension or termination and the reasons therefor; and
(3) It provides an opportunity for the member to be heard, orally or in writing, not less than five days before the effective date of the expulsion, suspension or termination by a person or body authorized to decide that the proposed expulsion, termination or suspension not take place.
(d) Any notice required under this section may be given by any method reasonably calculated to provide actual notice. Any notice given by mail must be given by first-class or registered mail sent to the last address of the member shown on the corporation’s records.
(e) Any action challenging an expulsion, suspension or termination of membership, including any claim alleging defective notice, must be commenced within one year after the date of the expulsion, suspension or termination. In the event such an action is successful the court may order any relief, including reinstatement, it finds equitable under the circumstances, but no vote of the members or of the board may be set aside solely because a person was at the time of the vote wrongfully excluded by virtue of the challenged expulsion, suspension or termination, unless the court finds further that the wrongful expulsion, suspension or termination was in bad faith and for the purpose, and with the effect, of wrongfully excluding the member from the vote or from the meeting at which the vote took place, so as to affect the outcome of the vote.
(f) This section governs only the procedures for expulsion, suspension or termination and not the substantive grounds therefor. An expulsion, suspension or termination based upon substantive grounds which violate contractual or other rights of the member or are otherwise unlawful, is not made valid by compliance with this section.
(g) A member who is expelled or suspended or whose membership is terminated shall be liable for any charges incurred, services or benefits actually rendered, dues, assessments or fees incurred before the expulsion, suspension or termination or arising from contract or otherwise.
(Amended by Stats. 1996, Ch. 589, Sec. 9. Effective January 1, 1997.)
5342.
  (a) An amendment of the articles or bylaws which would terminate all memberships or any class of memberships shall meet the requirements of this part and this section.
(b) Before such an amendment is adopted the corporation shall give written notice to members not less than 45 nor more than 90 days prior to any vote by the members on the amendment. The written notice shall describe the effect of the amendment on the corporation and the members. However, written notice need not be given at least 45 days prior to any vote by the members on the amendment if all members entitled to vote receive a written notice prior to the vote setting forth the information described in the preceding sentence and sign a written waiver of 45 days notice.
(c) Any such amendment shall be approved by the members (Section 5034).
(d) The articles or bylaws may impose additional requirements regarding termination of all memberships or any class of memberships.
(e) Upon request of a member the corporation shall provide at its option the rights set forth in either paragraph (1) or (2) of subdivision (a) of Section 6330 as soon as reasonably possible to allow the member to communicate with other members regarding the proposed amendment.
(f) Any such amendment shall terminate the rights members have pursuant to this part as members (Section 5056).
(g) The provisions of Section 5341 shall not apply to termination of all memberships or any class of memberships pursuant to an amendment of the articles or bylaws.
(Amended by Stats. 1986, Ch. 766, Sec. 29.)
ARTICLE 5. Rights and Obligations of Members and Creditors [5350 - 5354]  ( Article 5 added by Stats. 1978, Ch. 567. )

5350.
  (a) A member of a corporation is not, as such, personally liable for the debts, liabilities, or obligations of the corporation.
(b)  No person is liable for any obligation arising from membership unless the person was admitted to membership upon the person’s application or with the person’s consent.
(Added by Stats. 1978, Ch. 567.)
5351.
  A corporation may levy dues, assessments or fees upon its members pursuant to its articles or bylaws, but a member upon learning of them may avoid liability for them by promptly resigning from membership, except where the member is, by contract or otherwise, liable for them. Article or bylaw provisions authorizing such dues, assessments or fees do not, of themselves, create such liability.
(Added by Stats. 1978, Ch. 567.)
5352.
  (a) No action shall be brought by or on behalf of any creditor to reach and apply the liability, if any, of a member to the corporation to pay the amount due on such member’s membership or otherwise due to the corporation unless final judgment has been rendered in favor of the creditor against the corporation and execution has been returned unsatisfied in whole or in part or unless such proceedings would be useless.
(b) All creditors of the corporation, with or without reducing their claims to judgment, may intervene in any such creditor’s action to reach and apply unpaid amounts due the corporation and any or all members who owe amounts to the corporation may be joined in such action. Several judgments may be rendered for and against the parties to the action or in favor of a receiver for the benefit of the respective parties thereto.
(c) All amounts paid by any member in any such action shall be credited on the unpaid balance due the corporation by such member.
(Added by Stats. 1978, Ch. 567.)
5353.
  Nothing in this part shall be construed as in derogation of any rights or remedies which any creditor or member may have against any promoter, member, director, officer or the corporation because of participation in any fraud or illegality practiced upon such creditor or member by any such person or by the corporation in connection with the issue or sale of memberships or securities or in derogation of any rights which the corporation may have by rescission, cancellation or otherwise because of any fraud or illegality practiced on it by any such person in connection with the issue or sale of memberships or securities.
(Added by Stats. 1978, Ch. 567.)
5354.
  A person holding a membership as executor, administrator, guardian, trustee, receiver or in any representative or fiduciary capacity is not personally liable for any unpaid balance of the purchase price of the membership, or for any amounts owing to the corporation by the member, because the membership is so held; but the estate and funds in the hands of such fiduciary are liable therefor.
(Added by Stats. 1978, Ch. 567.)
CHAPTER 4. Distributions [5410 - 5420]  ( Chapter 4 added by Stats. 1978, Ch. 567. )

ARTICLE 1. Limitations [5410- 5410.]  ( Article 1 added by Stats. 1978, Ch. 567. )

5410.
  No corporation shall make any distribution. This section shall not apply to the purchase of a membership in a limited-equity housing cooperative, as defined in Section 33007.5 of the Health and Safety Code, which is organized as a public benefit corporation.
(Amended by Stats. 1992, Ch. 250, Sec. 2. Effective January 1, 1993.)

(b) Suit may be brought in the name of a corporation by a creditor, a director, the Attorney General, or, subject to meeting the requirements of Section 5710, a member. In any such action in addition to the remedy provided in subdivision (a), the court may award punitive damages for the benefit of the corporation against any director, officer, member or other person who with intent to defraud the corporation caused, received or aided and abetted in the making of any distribution.
(c) Any person sued under this section may implead all other persons liable under this section and may in the absence of fraud by a moving party compel contribution, either in that action or in an independent action against persons not joined in the action.
(d) This section shall not affect any liability which any person may have under the Uniform Voidable Transactions Act (Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 3439) of Title 2 of Part 2 of Division 4 of the Civil Code).
(Amended by Stats. 2015, Ch. 44, Sec. 19. (SB 161) Effective January 1, 2016.)
CHAPTER 5. Meetings and Voting [5510 - 5527]  ( Chapter 5 added by Stats. 1978, Ch. 567. )

ARTICLE 1. General Provisions [5510 - 5517]  ( Article 1 added by Stats. 1978, Ch. 567. )

5510.
  (a) Meetings of members may be held at a place within or without this state as may be stated in or fixed in accordance with the bylaws. If no other place is stated or so fixed, meetings of members shall be held at the principal office of the corporation. Subject to any limitations in the articles or the bylaws of the corporation, if authorized by the board of directors in its sole discretion, and subject to those guidelines and procedures as the board of directors may adopt, members not physically present in person (or, if proxies are allowed, by proxy) at a meeting of members may, by electronic transmission by and to the corporation (Sections 20 and 21), electronic video screen communication, conference telephone, or other means of remote 						communication, participate in a meeting of members, be deemed present in person (or, if proxies are allowed, by proxy), and vote at a meeting of members, subject to subdivision (f).
(b) A regular meeting of members shall be held on a date, time, and with the frequency stated in or fixed in accordance with the bylaws, but in any event in each year in which directors are to be elected at that meeting for the purpose of conducting such election, and to transact any other proper business which may be brought before the meeting.
(c) If a corporation with members is required by subdivision (b) to hold a regular meeting and fails to hold the regular meeting for a period of 60 days after the date designated therefor or, if no date has been designated, for a period of 15 months after the 						formation of the corporation, or after its last regular meeting, or if the corporation fails to hold a written ballot for a period of 60 days after the date designated therefor, then the superior court of the proper county may summarily order the meeting to be held or the ballot to be conducted upon the application of a member or the Attorney General, after notice to the corporation giving it an opportunity to be heard.
(d) The votes represented, either in person (or, if proxies are allowed, by proxy), at a meeting called or by written ballot ordered pursuant to subdivision (c), and entitled to be cast on the business to be transacted shall constitute a quorum, notwithstanding any provision of the articles or bylaws or in this part to the contrary. The court may issue such orders as may be appropriate including, without 						limitation, orders designating the time and place of the meeting, the record date for determination of members entitled to vote, and the form of notice of the meeting.
(e) Special meetings of members for any lawful purpose may be called by the board, the chairperson of the board, the president, or such other persons, if any, as are specified in the bylaws. In addition, special meetings of members for any lawful purpose may be called by 5 percent or more of the members.
(f) A meeting of the members may be conducted, in whole or in part, by electronic transmission by and to the corporation, electronic video screen communication, conference telephone, or other means of remote communication if the corporation implements reasonable measures: (1) to provide members and proxyholders, 						if proxies are allowed, a reasonable opportunity to participate in the meeting and to vote on matters submitted to the members, including an opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of the meeting substantially concurrently with those proceedings, (2) if any member or proxyholder, if proxies are allowed, votes or takes other action at the meeting by means of electronic 						transmission to the corporation, electronic video screen communication, conference telephone, or other means of remote communication, to maintain a record of that vote or action in its books and records, and (3) to verify that each person participating remotely is a member or proxyholder, if proxies are allowed. A corporation shall not conduct a meeting of members solely by electronic transmission by and to the corporation, electronic video screen communication, conference telephone, or other means of remote communication unless one or more of the following conditions apply: (A) all of the members consent; or (B) the board determines it is necessary or appropriate because of an emergency, as defined in paragraph (5) of subdivision (n) of Section 5140; or (C) the meeting is conducted on or before June 30, 2022.
(Amended by Stats. 2022, Ch. 617, Sec. 50. (SB 1202) Effective January 1, 2023.)
5511.
  (a) Whenever members are required or permitted to take any action at a meeting, a written notice of the meeting shall be given not less than 10 nor more than 90 days before the date of the meeting to each member who, on the record date for notice of the meeting, is entitled to vote thereat; provided, however, that if notice is given by mail, and the notice is not mailed by first-class, registered, or certified mail, that notice shall be given not less than 20 days before the meeting. Subject to subdivision (f), and subdivision (b) of Section 5512, that notice shall state the place, date and time of the meeting, the means of electronic transmission by and to the corporation (Sections 20 and 21), electronic video screen communication, conference 						telephone, or other means of remote communication, if any, by which members may participate in that meeting, and (1) in the case of a special meeting, the general nature of the business to be transacted, and no other business may be transacted, or (2) in the case of the regular meeting, those matters which the board, at the time the notice is given, intends to present for action by the members, but, except as provided in subdivision (b) of Section 5512, any proper matter may be presented at the meeting for such action. The notice of any meeting at which directors are to be elected shall include the names of all those who are nominees at the time the notice is given to members.
(b) (1) Notice of a members’ meeting or any report shall be given personally, by electronic transmission by the corporation, or by mail or 						other means of written communication, addressed to the member at the address of such member appearing on the books of the corporation or given by the member to the corporation for purpose of notice, or if no such address appears or is given, at the place where the principal office of the corporation is located or by publication at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the principal office is located. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the notice of a members’ meeting or any report may be sent by electronic communication or other means of remote communication if the board determines it is necessary or appropriate because of an emergency, as defined in paragraph (5) of subdivision (n) of Section 5140. An affidavit of giving of any notice or report as permitted because of an emergency or otherwise in accordance with the provisions of this part, executed by the secretary, 						assistant secretary, or any transfer agent, shall be prima facie evidence of the giving of the notice or report.
(2) If any notice or report addressed to a member at the address of such member appearing on the books of the corporation is 						returned to the corporation by the United States Postal Service marked to indicate that the United States Postal Service is unable to deliver the notice or report to the member at such address, all future notices or reports shall be deemed to have been duly given without further mailing if the same shall be available for the member upon written demand of the member at the principal office of the corporation for a period of one year from the date of the giving of the notice or report to all other members.
(3) (A) Notice given by electronic transmission by the corporation under this subdivision shall be valid only if it complies with Section 20. Notwithstanding the foregoing, notice shall not be given by electronic transmission by the corporation under this subdivision after either of the following:
(i) The corporation is unable to deliver two consecutive notices to the member by that means.
(ii) The inability to so deliver the notices to the member becomes known to the secretary, any assistant secretary, the transfer agent, or other person responsible for the giving of the notice.
(B) This paragraph shall not apply if notices are provided by electronic communication or other means of remote communication as permitted because of an emergency.
(c) Upon request in writing to the corporation addressed to the attention of the chairperson of the board, president, vice president, or secretary by any person (other than the board) entitled to call a special 						meeting of members, the officer forthwith shall cause notice to be given to the members entitled to vote that a meeting will be held at a time fixed by the board, not less than 35 nor more than 90 days after the receipt of the request. If the notice is not given within 20 days after receipt of the request, the persons entitled to call the meeting may give the notice or the superior court of the proper county shall summarily order the giving of the notice, after notice to the corporation giving it an opportunity to be heard. The court may issue such orders as may be appropriate, including, without limitation, orders designating the time and place of the meeting, the record date for determination of members entitled to vote, and the form of notice.
(d) When a members’ meeting is adjourned to another time or place, unless the bylaws otherwise 						require and except as provided in this subdivision, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof (or the means of electronic transmission by and to the corporation, conference telephone, or other means of remote communication, or electronic video screen communication, if any, by which members may participate) are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. No meeting may be adjourned for more than 45 days. At the adjourned meeting the corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for notice or voting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each member who, on the record date for notice of the meeting, is entitled to vote at the meeting.
(e) The transactions of any meeting 						of members, however called and noticed, and wherever held, are as valid as though had at a meeting duly held after regular call and notice, if a quorum is present either in person or by proxy, and if, either before or after the meeting, each of the persons entitled to vote, not present in person or by proxy, provides a waiver of notice or consent to the holding of the meeting, or an approval of the minutes thereof in writing. All such waivers, consents, and approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of and presence at such meeting, except when the person objects, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened and except that attendance at a meeting is not a waiver of any right to object to the 						consideration of matters required by this part to be included in the notice but not so included, if such objection is expressly made at the meeting. Neither the business to be transacted at nor the purpose of any regular or special meeting of members need be specified in any written waiver of notice, consent to the holding of the meeting, or approval of the minutes thereof, unless otherwise provided in the articles or bylaws, except as provided in subdivision (f).
(f) Any approval of the members required under Section 5222, 5224, 5812, or 6610, other than unanimous approval by those entitled to vote, shall be valid only if the general nature of the proposal so approved was stated in the notice of meeting, or in any written waiver of notice.
(g) A court may find that notice not 						given in conformity with this section is still valid, if it was given in a fair and reasonable manner.
(Amended by Stats. 2022, Ch. 617, Sec. 51. (SB 1202) Effective January 1, 2023.)
5512.
  (a) One-third of the voting power, represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of members, but, subject to subdivisions (b) and (c), a bylaw may set a different quorum. Any bylaw amendment to increase the quorum may be adopted only by approval of the members (Section 5034). If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the majority of the voting power represented at the meeting, entitled to vote, and voting on any matter shall be the act of the members, unless the vote of a greater number or voting by classes is required by this part or the articles or bylaws.
(b) Where a bylaw authorizes a corporation to conduct a meeting with a quorum of less than one-third of the voting power, then the only matters that may be voted upon at any regular meeting actually attended, in person or by proxy, by less than one-third of the voting power are matters notice of the general nature of which was given, pursuant to the first sentence of subdivision (a) of Section 5511.
(c) Subject to subdivision (b), the members present at a duly called or held meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to transact business until adjournment notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough members to leave less than a quorum, if any action taken (other than adjournment) is approved by at least a majority of the members required to constitute a quorum or, if required by this division or the articles or the bylaws, the vote of a greater number or voting by classes.
(d) In the absence of a quorum, any meeting of members may be adjourned from time to time by the vote of a majority of the votes represented either in person or by proxy, but no other business may be transacted, except as provided in subdivision (c).
(Amended by Stats. 2000, Ch. 485, Sec. 11. Effective January 1, 2001.)
5513.
  (a) Subject to subdivision (e), and unless prohibited in the articles or bylaws, any action which may be taken at any regular or special meeting of members may be taken without a meeting if the corporation distributes a written ballot to every member entitled to vote on the matter. Unless otherwise provided by the articles or bylaws and if approved by the board of directors, that ballot and any related material may be sent by electronic transmission by the corporation (Section 20) and responses may be returned to the corporation by electronic transmission to the corporation (Section 21). That ballot shall set forth the proposed action, provide an opportunity to specify approval or disapproval of any proposal, and provide a reasonable time within which to return the ballot to the corporation.
(b) Approval by written ballot pursuant to this section shall be valid only when the number of votes cast by ballot within the time period specified equals or exceeds the quorum required to be present at a meeting authorizing the action, and the number of approvals equals or exceeds the number of votes that would be required to approve at a meeting at which the total number of votes cast was the same as the number of votes cast by ballot.
(c) Ballots shall be solicited in a manner consistent with the requirements of subdivision (b) of Section 5511, and Section 5514. All such solicitations shall indicate the number of responses needed to meet the quorum requirement and, with respect to ballots other than for the election of directors, shall state the percentage of approvals necessary to pass the measure submitted. The solicitation must specify the time by which the ballot must be received in order to be counted.
(d) Unless otherwise provided in the articles or bylaws, a written ballot may not be revoked.
(e) Directors may be elected by written ballot under this section, where authorized by the articles or bylaws, except that election by written ballot may not be authorized where the directors are elected by cumulative voting pursuant to Section 5616.
(f) When directors are to be elected by written ballot and the articles or bylaws prescribe a nomination procedure, the procedure may provide for a date for the close of nominations prior to the printing and distributing of the written ballots.
(Amended by Stats. 2004, Ch. 254, Sec. 18. Effective January 1, 2005.)
5514.
  (a) Any form of proxy or written ballot distributed to 10 or more members of a corporation with 100 or more members shall afford an opportunity on the proxy or form of written ballot to specify a choice between approval and disapproval of each matter or group of related matters intended, at the time the written ballot or proxy is distributed, to be acted upon at the meeting for which the proxy is solicited or by such written ballot, and shall provide, subject to reasonable specified conditions, that where the person solicited specifies a choice with respect to any such matter the vote shall be cast in accordance therewith.
(b) In any election of directors, any form of proxy or written ballot in which the directors to be voted upon are named therein as candidates and which is marked by a member “withhold” or otherwise marked in a manner indicating that the authority to vote for the election of directors is withheld shall not be voted either for or against the election of a director.
(c) Failure to comply with this section shall not invalidate any corporate action taken, but may be the basis for challenging any proxy at a meeting or written ballot and the superior court may compel compliance therewith at the suit of any member.
(Amended by Stats. 1979, Ch. 724.)
5515.
  (a) If for any reason it is impractical or unduly difficult for any corporation to call or conduct a meeting of its members, delegates, or directors, or otherwise obtain their consent, in the manner prescribed by its articles or bylaws, or this part, then the superior court of the proper county, upon petition of a director, officer, delegate, member or the Attorney General, may order that such a meeting be called or that a written ballot or other form of obtaining the vote of members, delegates, or directors be authorized, in such a manner as the court finds fair and equitable under the circumstances.
(b) The court shall, in an order issued pursuant to this section, provide for a method of notice reasonably designed to give actual notice to all parties who would be entitled to notice of a meeting held pursuant to the articles, bylaws and this part, whether or not the method results in actual notice to every such person, or conforms to the notice requirements that would otherwise apply. In a proceeding under this section the court may determine who the members or directors are.
(c) The order issued pursuant to this section may dispense with any requirement relating to the holding of and voting at meetings or obtaining of votes, including any requirement as to quorums or as to the number or percentage of votes needed for approval, that would otherwise be imposed by the articles, bylaws, or this part.
(d) Wherever practical any order issued pursuant to this section shall limit the subject matter of the meetings or other forms of consent authorized to items, including amendments to the articles or bylaws, the resolution of which will or may enable the corporation to continue managing its affairs without further resort to this section; provided, however, that an order under this section may also authorize the obtaining of whatever votes and approvals are necessary for the dissolution, merger, sale of assets or reorganization of the corporation.
(e) Any meeting or other method of obtaining the vote of members, delegates, or directors conducted pursuant to an order issued under this section, and which complies with all the provisions of such order, is for all purposes a valid meeting or vote, as the case may be, and shall have the same force and effect as if it complied with every requirement imposed by the articles, bylaws and this part.
(Amended by Stats. 1986, Ch. 766, Sec. 30.)
5516.
  Any action required or permitted to be taken by the members may be taken without a meeting, if all members shall individually or collectively consent in writing to the action. The written consent or consents shall be filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the members. The action by written consent shall have the same force and effect as the unanimous vote of the members.
(Added by Stats. 1980, Ch. 1155.)
5517.
  (a) If the name signed on a ballot, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment corresponds to the name of a member, the corporation if acting in good faith is entitled to accept the ballot, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment and give it effect as the act of the member.
(b) If the name signed on a ballot, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment does not correspond to the record name of a member, the corporation if acting in good faith is nevertheless entitled to accept the ballot, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment and give it effect as the act of the member if any of the following occur:
(1) The member is an entity and the name signed purports to be that of an officer or agent of the entity.
(2) The name signed purports to be that of an attorney-in-fact of the member and if the corporation requests, evidence acceptable to the corporation of the signatory’s authority to sign for the member has been presented with respect to the ballot, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment.
(3) Two or more persons hold the membership as cotenants or fiduciaries and the name signed purports to be the name of at least one of the coholders and the person signing appears to be acting on behalf of all the coholders.
(c) The corporation is entitled to reject a ballot, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment if the secretary or other officer or agent authorized to tabulate votes, acting in good faith, has a reasonable basis for doubt concerning the validity of the signature or the signatory’s authority to sign for the member.
(d) The corporation and any officer or agent thereof who accepts or rejects a ballot, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment in good faith and in accordance with the standards of this section shall not be liable in damages to the member for the consequences of the acceptance or rejection.
(e) Corporate action based on the acceptance or rejection of a ballot, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment under this section is valid unless a court of competent jurisdiction determines otherwise.
(Added by Stats. 1996, Ch. 589, Sec. 11. Effective January 1, 1997.)

5520.
  (a) As to directors elected by members, there shall be available to the members reasonable nomination and election procedures given the nature, size and operations of the corporation.
(b) If a corporation complies with all of the provisions of Sections 5521, 5522, 5523, and 5524 applicable to a corporation with the same number of members, the nomination and election procedures of that corporation shall be deemed reasonable. However, those sections do not prescribe the exclusive 				means of making available to the members reasonable procedures for nomination and election of directors. A corporation may make available to the members other reasonable nomination and election procedures given the nature, size, and operations of the corporation.
(Amended by Stats. 1996, Ch. 589, Sec. 12. Effective January 1, 1997.)
5521.
  A corporation with 500 or more members may provide that, except for directors who are elected as authorized by Section 5152 or 5153, and except as provided in Section 5522, any person who is qualified to be elected to the board of directors of the corporation may be nominated:
(a) By any method authorized by the bylaws, or if no method is set forth in the bylaws by any method authorized by the board.

(Amended by Stats. 1979, Ch. 724.)
5611.
  (a) The bylaws may provide or, in the absence of such provision, the board may fix, in advance, a date as the record date for the purpose of determining the members entitled to notice of any meeting of members. Such record date shall not be more than 90 nor less than 10 days before the date of the meeting. If no record date is fixed, members at the close of business on the business day preceding the day on which notice is given or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the business day preceding the day on which the meeting is held are entitled to notice of a meeting of members. A determination of members entitled to notice of a meeting of members shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting unless the board fixes a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
(b) The bylaws may provide or, in the absence of such provision, the board may fix, in advance, a date as the record date for the purpose of determining the members entitled to vote at a meeting of members. Such record date shall not be more than 60 days before the date of the meeting. Such record date shall also apply in the case of an adjournment of the meeting unless the board fixes a new record date for the adjourned meeting. If no record date is fixed, members on the day of the meeting who are otherwise eligible to vote are entitled to vote at the meeting of members or, in the case of an adjourned meeting, members on the day of the adjourned meeting who are otherwise eligible to vote are entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting of members.
(c) The bylaws may provide or, in the absence of such provision, the board may fix, in advance, a date as the record date for the purpose of determining the members entitled to cast written ballots (Section 5513). Such record date shall not be more than 60 days before the day on which the first written ballot is mailed or solicited. If no record date is fixed, members on the day the first written ballot is mailed or solicited who are otherwise eligible to vote are entitled to cast written ballots.
(d) The bylaws may provide or, in the absence of such provision, the board may fix, in advance, a date as the record date for the purpose of determining the members entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any other lawful action. Such record date shall not be more than 60 days prior to such other action. If no record date is fixed, members at the close of business on the day on which the board adopts the resolution relating thereto, or the 60th day prior to the date of such other action, whichever is later, are entitled to exercise such rights.
(Amended by Stats. 1981, Ch. 587, Sec. 15.)
5612.
  If a membership stands of record in the names of two or more persons, whether fiduciaries, members of a partnership, joint tenants, tenants in common, spouses as community property, tenants by the entirety, or otherwise, or if two or more persons (including proxyholders) have the same fiduciary relationship respecting the same membership, unless the secretary of the corporation is given written notice to the contrary and is furnished with a copy of the instrument or order appointing them or creating the relationship wherein it is so provided, their acts with respect to voting shall have the following effect:
(a) If only one votes, such act binds all;
(b) If more than one vote, the act of the majority so voting binds all.
(Amended by Stats. 2016, Ch. 50, Sec. 22. (SB 1005) Effective January 1, 2017.)
5613.
  (a) Any member may authorize another person or persons to act by proxy with respect to such membership, except that this right may be limited or withdrawn by the articles or bylaws, subject to subdivision (e). Any proxy purported to be executed in accordance with the provisions of this part shall be presumptively valid.
(b) No proxy shall be valid after the expiration of 11 months from the date thereof unless otherwise provided in the proxy, except that the maximum term of any proxy shall be three years from the date of execution. Every proxy continues in full force and effect until revoked by the person executing it prior to the vote pursuant thereto. Such revocation may be effected by a writing delivered to the corporation stating that the proxy is revoked or by a subsequent proxy executed by the person executing the prior proxy and presented to the meeting, or as to any meeting by attendance at such meeting and voting in person by the person executing the proxy. The dates contained on the forms of proxy presumptively determine the order of execution, regardless of the postmark dates on the envelopes in which they are mailed.
(c) A proxy is not revoked by the death or incapacity of the maker or the termination of a membership as a result thereof unless, before the vote is counted, written notice of such death or incapacity is received by the corporation.
(d) The proxy of a member may not be irrevocable.
(e) Subdivision (a) notwithstanding, no amendment of the articles or bylaws repealing, restricting, creating or expanding proxy rights may be adopted without approval by the members (Section 5034).
(f) Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, any proxy covering matters requiring a vote of the members pursuant to Section 5222, Section 5224, subdivision (e) of this section, Section 5812, paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) of Section 5911, Section 6012, subdivision (a) of Section 6015, or Section 6610 is not valid as to such matters unless it sets forth the general nature of the matter to be voted on, or, in the event of a vote pursuant to Section 5220, unless the proxy lists those nominated at the time the notice of the vote is given to members.
(Amended by Stats. 1981, Ch. 587, Sec. 16.)
5614.
  A voting agreement or voting trust agreement entered into by a member or members of a corporation shall not be enforced.
(Amended by Stats. 1979, Ch. 724.)
5615.
  (a) In advance of any meeting of members the board may appoint inspectors of election to act at the meeting and any adjournment thereof. If inspectors of election are not so appointed, or if any persons so appointed fail to appear or refuse to act, the chairperson of any meeting of members may, and on the request of any member or a member’s proxy shall, appoint inspectors of election (or persons to replace those who so fail or refuse) at the meeting. The number of inspectors shall be either one or three. If appointed at a meeting on the request of one or more members or proxies, the majority of members represented in person or by proxy shall determine whether one or three inspectors are to be appointed. 						In the case of any action by written ballot (Section 5513), the board may similarly appoint inspectors of election to act with powers and duties as set forth in this section.
(b) The inspectors of election shall determine the number of memberships outstanding and the voting power of each, the number represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum and the authenticity, validity and effect of proxies, receive votes, ballots or consents, hear and determine all challenges and questions in any way arising in connection with the right to vote, count and tabulate all votes or consents, determine when the polls shall close, determine the result and do such acts as may be proper to conduct the election or vote with fairness to all members.
(c) The inspectors of election 						shall perform their duties impartially, in good faith, to the best of their ability and as expeditiously as is practical. If there are three inspectors of election, the decision, act or certificate of a majority is effective in all respects as the decision, act or certificate of all. Any report or certificate made by the inspectors of election is prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.
(Amended by Stats. 2022, Ch. 617, Sec. 52. (SB 1202) Effective January 1, 2023.)
5616.
  (a) If the articles or bylaws authorize cumulative voting, but not otherwise, every member entitled to vote at any election of directors may cumulate the member’s votes and give one candidate a number of votes equal to the number of directors to be elected multiplied by the number of votes to which the member is entitled, or distribute the member’s votes on the same principle among as many candidates as the member thinks fit. An article or bylaw provision authorizing cumulative voting may be repealed or amended only by approval of the members (Section 5034), except that the governing article or bylaw provision may require the vote of a greater proportion of the members, or of the members of any class, for its repeal.
(b) No member shall be entitled to cumulate votes for a candidate or candidates unless the candidate’s name or candidates’ names have been placed in nomination prior to the voting and a member has given notice at the meeting prior to the voting of the member’s intention to cumulate votes. If any one member has given this notice, all members may cumulate their votes for candidates in nomination.
(c) In any election of directors by cumulative voting, the candidates receiving the highest number of votes are elected, subject to any lawful provision specifying election by classes.
(d) In any election of directors not governed by subdivision (c), unless otherwise provided in the articles or bylaws, the candidates receiving the highest number of votes are elected.
(e) Elections for directors need not be by ballot unless a member demands election by ballot at the meeting and before the voting begins or unless the bylaws so require.
(Amended by Stats. 1984, Ch. 812, Sec. 3.)
5617.
  (a) Upon the filing of an action therefor by any director or member, or by any person who had the right to vote in the election at issue, the superior court of the proper county shall determine the validity of any election or appointment of any director of any corporation.
(b) Any person bringing an action under this section shall give notice of the action to the Attorney General, who may intervene.
(c) Upon the filing of the complaint, and before any further proceedings are had, the court shall enter an order fixing a date for the hearing, which shall be within five days unless for good cause shown a later date is fixed, and requiring notice of the date for the hearing and a copy of the complaint to be served upon the corporation and upon the person whose purported election or appointment is questioned and upon any person (other than the plaintiff) whom the plaintiff alleges to have been elected or appointed, in the manner in which a summons is required to be served, or, if the court so directs, by registered mail; and the court may make such further requirements as to notice as appear to be proper under the circumstances.
(d) The court, consistent with the provisions of this part and in conformity with the articles and bylaws to the extent feasible, may determine the person entitled to the office of director or may order a new election to be held or appointment to be made, may determine the validity of the issuance of memberships and the right of persons to vote and may direct such other relief as may be just and proper.

CHAPTER 7. Members’ Derivative Actions [5710- 5710.]  ( Chapter 7 added by Stats. 1978, Ch. 567. )

5710.
  (a) Subdivisions (c) through (f) notwithstanding, no motion to require a bond shall be granted in an action brought by 100 members or the authorized number (Section 5036), whichever is less.
(b) No action may be instituted or maintained in the right of any corporation by any member of such corporation unless both of the following conditions exist:
(1) The plaintiff alleges in the complaint that plaintiff was a member at the time of the transaction or any part thereof of which plaintiff complains; and
(2) The plaintiff alleges in the complaint with particularity plaintiff’s efforts to secure from the board such action as plaintiff desires, or the reasons for not making such effort, and alleges further that plaintiff has either informed the corporation or the board in writing of the ultimate facts of each cause of action against each defendant or delivered to the corporation or the board a true copy of the complaint which plaintiff proposes to file.
(c) Subject to subdivision (a), in any action referred to in subdivision (b), at any time within 30 days after service of summons upon the corporation or upon any defendant who is an officer or director of the corporation, or held such office at the time of the acts complained of, the corporation or such defendant may move the court for an order, upon notice and hearing, requiring the plaintiff to furnish a bond as hereinafter provided. The motion shall be based upon one or both of the following grounds:
(1) That there is no reasonable possibility that the prosecution of the cause of action alleged in the complaint against the moving party will benefit the corporation or its members, economically or otherwise.
(2) That the moving party, if other than the corporation, did not participate in the transaction complained of in any capacity.
The court on application of the corporation or any defendant may, for good cause shown, extend the 30-day period for an additional period or periods not exceeding 60 days.
(d) At the hearing upon any motion pursuant to subdivision (c), the court shall consider such evidence, written or oral, by witnesses or affidavit, as may be material (1) to the ground or grounds upon which the motion is based, or (2) to a determination of the probable reasonable expenses, including attorneys’ fees, of the corporation and the moving party which will be incurred in the defense of the action. If the court determines, after hearing the evidence adduced by the parties, that the moving party has established a probability in support of any of the grounds upon which the motion is based, the court shall fix the amount of the bond, not to exceed fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), to be furnished by the plaintiff for reasonable expenses, including attorneys’ fees, which may be incurred by the moving party and the corporation in connection with the action, including expenses for which the corporation may become liable pursuant to Section 5238. A ruling by the court on the motion shall not be a determination of any issue in the action or of the merits thereof. If the court, upon the motion, makes a determination that a bond shall be furnished by the plaintiff as to any one or more defendants, the action shall be dismissed as to such defendant or defendants, unless the bond required by the court has been furnished within such reasonable time as may be fixed by the court.
(e) If the plaintiff shall, either before or after a motion is made pursuant to subdivision (c), or any order or determination pursuant to the motion, furnish a bond or bonds in the aggregate amount of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) to secure the reasonable expenses of the parties entitled to make the motion, the plaintiff has complied with the requirements of this section and with any order for a bond theretofore made, and any such motion then pending shall be dismissed and no further or additional bond shall be required.
(f) If a motion is filed pursuant to subdivision (c), no pleadings need be filed by the corporation or any other defendant and the prosecution of the action shall be stayed until 10 days after the motion has been disposed of.
(Amended by Stats. 1982, Ch. 517, Sec. 187.)

5810.
  (a) By complying with the provisions of this chapter, a corporation may amend its articles from time to time, in any and as many respects as may be desired, so long as its articles as amended contain only such provisions as it would be lawful to insert in original articles filed at the time of the filing of the amendment or as authorized by Section 5813.5 and, if a change in the rights of members or an exchange, reclassification or cancellation of memberships is to be made, such provisions as may be necessary to effect such change, exchange, reclassification or cancellation. It is the intent of the Legislature in adopting this section to exercise to the fullest extent the reserve power of the state over 						corporations and to authorize any amendment of the articles covered by the preceding sentence regardless of whether any provision contained in the amendment was permissible at the time of the original incorporation of the corporation.
(b) A corporation shall not amend its articles to add any statement or to alter any statement which may appear in the original articles of the initial street address and initial mailing address of the corporation, the names and addresses of the first directors, or the name and address of the initial agent, except to correct an error in the statement or to delete the information after the corporation has filed a statement under Section 6210.
(Amended by Stats. 2012, Ch. 494, Sec. 14. (SB 1532) Effective January 1, 2013.)

(Amended by Stats. 1979, Ch. 724.)
5812.
  (a) Except as provided in this section or Section 5813.5, amendments may be adopted if approved by the board and approved by the members (Section 5034) and approved by such other person or persons, if any, as required by the articles. The approval by the members or other person or persons may be before or after the approval by the board.
(b) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), the following amendments may be adopted by approval of the board alone:
(1) An amendment extending the corporate existence or making the corporate existence perpetual, if the corporation was organized prior to August 						14, 1929.
(2) An amendment deleting the initial street address and initial mailing address of the corporation, the names and addresses of the first directors, or the name and address of the initial agent.
(3) Any amendment, at a time the corporation has no members; provided, however, that if the articles require approval by any person for an amendment, that an amendment may not be adopted without such approval.
(4) An amendment adopted pursuant to Section 9913.
(c) Whenever the articles require for corporate action the approval of a particular class of members or of a larger proportion of, or all of, the votes of any class, or of a larger proportion of, or all 						of, the directors, than is otherwise required by this part, the provision in the articles requiring such greater vote shall not be altered, amended or repealed except by such class or such greater vote, unless otherwise provided in the articles.

5813.
  An amendment must also be approved by the members (Section 5034) of a class, whether or not such class is entitled to vote thereon by the provisions of the articles or bylaws, if the amendment would materially and adversely affect the rights of that class as to voting or transfer in a manner different than such action affects another class.
(Amended by Stats. 1981, Ch. 587, Sec. 17.)
5813.5.
  (a) A public benefit corporation may amend its articles to change its status to that of a mutual benefit corporation, a social purpose corporation, a religious corporation, a business corporation, or a cooperative corporation by complying with this section and the other sections of this chapter.
The Secretary of State shall notify the Franchise Tax Board, in the manner and at the times agreed upon by the Secretary of State and the Franchise Tax Board, of any amendments to a public benefit corporation’s articles.
(b) If the public benefit corporation has any assets, an amendment to change its status to a mutual benefit corporation, business corporation, social purpose corporation, 				 or cooperative corporation shall be approved in advance in writing by the Attorney General. If the public benefit corporation has no assets, the Attorney General shall be given a copy of the amendment at least 20 days before the amendment is filed.
(c) Amended articles authorized by this section shall include the provisions which would have been required (other than the initial street address and initial mailing address of the corporation and the name of the initial agent for service of process if a statement has been filed pursuant to Section 6210), and may in addition only include those provisions which would have been permitted, in original articles filed by the type of corporation (mutual benefit, religious, business, social purpose, or cooperative) into which the public benefit corporation is changing its status.
(d) In the case of a change of status to a business 				 corporation, social purpose corporation, or cooperative corporation, if the Franchise Tax Board has issued a determination exempting the corporation from tax as provided in Section 23701 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, the corporation shall be subject to Section 23221 of the Revenue and Taxation Code upon filing the certificate of amendment.
(Amended by Stats. 2014, Ch. 694, Sec. 68. (SB 1301) Effective January 1, 2015.)

(5) If the amendment is one for which the approval of a person or persons other than the incorporators, directors, or members is required, that the approval of such person or persons has been obtained.
(b) In the event of an amendment of the articles pursuant to a merger, the filing of the officers’ certificate and agreement pursuant to Section 6014 shall be in lieu of any filing required under this chapter.
(Amended by Stats. 1979, Ch. 724.)
5815.

(Amended by Stats. 1979, Ch. 724.)
5816.
  The certificate of amendment shall establish the wording of the amendment or amended articles by one or more of the following means:
(a) By stating that the articles shall be amended to read as therein set forth in full.
(b) By stating that any provision of the articles, which shall be identified by the numerical or other designation given it in the articles or by stating the wording thereof, shall be stricken from the articles or shall be amended to read as set forth in the certificate.

5817.
  Upon the filing of the certificate of amendment, the articles shall be amended in accordance with the certificate and any change, reclassification, or cancellation of memberships shall be effected, and a copy of the certificate, certified by the Secretary of State, is prima facie evidence of the performance of the conditions necessary to the adoption of the amendment.

(Amended by Stats. 2022, Ch. 617, Sec. 53. (SB 1202) Effective January 1, 2023.)
5818.
  A corporation formed for a limited period may at any time subsequent to the expiration of the term of its corporate existence, extend the term of its existence by an amendment to its articles removing any provision limiting the term of its existence and providing for perpetual existence. If the filing of the certificate of amendment providing for perpetual existence would be prohibited if it were original articles by the provisions of Section 5122, the Secretary of State shall not file such certificate unless, by the same or a concurrently filed certificate of amendment, the articles of such corporation are amended to adopt a new available name. For the purpose of the adoption of any such amendment, persons who have been functioning as directors of such corporation shall be considered to have been validly elected even though their election may have occurred after the expiration of the original term of the corporate existence.
(Added by Stats. 1978, Ch. 567.)
5819.
  (a) A corporation may restate in a single certificate the entire text of its articles as amended by filing an officers’ certificate or, in circumstances where incorporators or the board may amend a corporation’s articles pursuant to Sections 5811 and 5815, a certificate signed and verified by a majority of the incorporators or the board, as applicable, entitled “Restated Articles of Incorporation of (insert name of corporation)” that shall set forth the articles as amended to the date of filing of the certificate, except that the signatures and acknowledgments of the articles by the incorporators and any statements regarding the effect of any prior amendment upon memberships and any provisions of agreements of 						merger (other than amendments to the articles of the surviving corporation), and the initial street address and initial mailing address of the corporation and the names and addresses of the first directors and of the initial agent for service of process shall be omitted (except that the initial street address and initial mailing address of the corporation and the names and addresses of the initial agent for service of process and, if previously set forth in the articles, the initial directors, shall not be omitted prior to the time that the corporation has filed a statement under Section 6210). Those omissions are not alterations or amendments of the articles. The certificate may also itself alter or amend the articles in any respect, in which case the certificate must comply with Section 5814 or 5815, as the case may be, and Section 5816.
(b) If the certificate does not itself alter or amend the articles in any respect, it shall be approved by the board or, prior to the issuance of any memberships and the naming and election of directors, by a majority of the incorporators, and shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter relating to an amendment of the articles not requiring approval of the members (Section 5034). If the certificate does itself alter or amend the articles, it shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter relating to the amendment or amendments so made.

(b) The Attorney General may, at the corporation’s request, and pursuant to such regulations as the Attorney General may issue, give rulings as to whether the Attorney General will or may oppose a proposed action, or article amendment, as inconsistent with or proscribed by the requirements of a charitable trust.

The merger and any amendment of the articles of the surviving corporation contained in the merger agreement shall thereupon be effective (subject to subdivision (c) of Section 5008 and subject to the provisions of Section 6018) and the several parties thereto shall be one surviving corporation. The Secretary of State may certify a copy of the merger agreement separate from the officers’ certificates attached thereto.

The Secretary of State may certify a copy of the agreement of merger separate from the officers’ certificates and certificates of merger attached thereto.
(g) A copy of an agreement of merger certified on or after the effective date by an official having custody thereof has the same force in evidence as the original and, except as against the state, is conclusive evidence of the performance of all conditions precedent to the merger, the existence on the effective date of the surviving party to the merger, the performance of the conditions necessary 						to the adoption of any amendment to the articles, if applicable, contained in the agreement of merger, and the merger of the constituent corporations, either by themselves or together with other constituent parties, into the surviving party to the merger.

ARTICLE 3. Rights of Inspection [6330 - 6338]  ( Article 3 added by Stats. 1978, Ch. 567. )

6330.
  (a) Subject to Sections 6331 and 6332, and unless the corporation provides a reasonable alternative pursuant to subdivision (c), a member may do either or both of the following as permitted by subdivision (b):
(1) Inspect and copy the record of all the members’ names, addresses and voting rights, at reasonable times, upon five business days’ prior written demand upon the corporation which demand shall state the purpose for which the inspection rights are requested; or
(2) Obtain from the secretary of the corporation, upon written demand and tender of a reasonable charge, an alphabetized list of the names, addresses, and voting rights of those members entitled to vote for the election of directors, as of the most recent record date for which it has been compiled or as of a date specified by the member subsequent to the date of demand. The demand shall state the purpose for which the list is requested. The membership list shall be made available on or before the later of 10 business days after the demand is received or after the date specified therein as the date as of which the list is to be compiled.
(b) The rights set forth in subdivision (a) may be exercised by:
(1) Any member, for a purpose reasonably related to the person’s interest as a member. Where the corporation reasonably believes that the information will be used for another purpose, or where it provides a reasonable alternative pursuant to subdivision (c), it may deny the member access to the list. In any subsequent action brought by the member under Section 6336, the court shall enforce the rights set forth in subdivision (a) unless the corporation proves that the member will allow use of the information for purposes unrelated to the person’s interest as a member or that the alternative method offered reasonably achieves the proper purpose set forth in the demand.
(2) The authorized number of members for a purpose reasonably related to the members’ interest as members.
(c) The corporation may, within 10 business days after receiving a demand under subdivision (a), deliver to the person or persons making the demand a written offer of an alternative method of achieving the purpose identified in the demand without providing access to or a copy of the membership list. An alternative method which reasonably and in a timely manner accomplishes the proper purpose set forth in a demand made under subdivision (a) shall be deemed a reasonable alternative, unless within a reasonable time after acceptance of the offer the corporation fails to do those things which it offered to do. Any rejection of the offer shall be in writing and shall indicate the reasons the alternative proposed by the corporation does not meet the proper purpose of the demand made pursuant to subdivision (a).
(Amended by Stats. 1989, Ch. 451, Sec. 1.)
6331.
  (a) Where the corporation, in good faith, and with a substantial basis, believes that the membership list, demanded under Section 6330 by the authorized number (Section 5036), will be used for a purpose not reasonably related to the interests as members of the person or persons making the demand (hereinafter called the requesting parties) as members or provides a reasonable alternative pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 6330, it may petition the superior court of the proper county for an order setting aside the demand.
(b) Except as provided in subdivision (c), a petition for an order to show cause why a protective order pursuant to subdivision (d) should not issue shall be filed within 10 business days after the demand by the authorized number under Section 6330 or receipt of a written rejection by the authorized number of an offer made pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 6330, whichever is later. The petition shall be accompanied by an application for a hearing on the petition. Upon the filing of the petition, the court shall issue a protective order staying production of the list demanded until the hearing on the order to show cause. The court shall set the hearing on the order to show cause not more than 20 days from the date of the filing of the petition. The order to show cause shall be granted unless the court finds that there is no reasonable probability that the corporation will make the showing required under subdivision (f).
(c) A corporation may file a petition under this section more than 10 business days after the demand or rejection under Section 6330, but only upon a showing the delay was caused by excusable neglect. In no event, however, may any petition under this section be considered if filed more than 30 days after the requesting parties’ demand or rejection, whichever is later.
(d) Upon the return day of the order to show cause, the court may issue a protective order staying production of the list demanded until final adjudication of the petition filed pursuant to this section. No protective order shall issue under this subdivision unless the court finds that the rights of the requesting parties can reasonably be preserved and that the corporation is likely to make the showing required by subdivision (f) or the court is likely to issue a protective order pursuant to subdivision (g).
(e) If the corporation fails to file a petition within the time allowed by subdivision (b) or (c), whichever is applicable, or fails to obtain a protective order under subdivision (d), then the corporation shall comply with the demand, and no further action may be brought by the corporation under this section.
(f) The court shall issue the final order setting aside the demand only if the corporation proves:
(1) That there is a reasonable probability that the requesting parties will permit use of the membership list for a purpose unrelated to their interests as members; or
(2) That the method offered by the corporation is a reasonable alternative in that it reasonably achieves the proper purpose set forth in the requesting parties’ demand and that the corporation intends and is able to effectuate the reasonable alternative.
(g) In the final order, the court may, in its discretion, order an alternative mechanism for achieving the proper purposes of the requesting parties, or impose just and proper conditions upon the use of the membership list which reasonably assures compliance with Sections 6330 and 6338.
(h) The court shall award reasonable costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, to requesting parties who successfully oppose any petition or application filed pursuant to this section.
(i) Where the corporation has neither, within the time allowed, complied with a demand by the authorized number (Section 5036) under Section 6330, nor obtained a protective order staying production of the list, or a final order setting aside the demand, which is then in effect, the requesting parties may petition the superior court of the proper county for a writ of mandamus pursuant to Section 1085 of the Code of Civil Procedure compelling the corporation to comply with the demand. At the hearing, the court shall hear the parties summarily, by affidavit or otherwise, and shall issue a peremptory writ of mandamus unless it appears that the demand was not made by an authorized number (Section 5036), that the demand has been complied with, that the corporation, pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 6330, made an offer which was not rejected in writing within a reasonable time, or that a protective or final order properly issued under subdivision (d), (f) or (g) is then in effect. No inquiry may be made in such proceeding into the use for which the authorized number seek the list. The court shall award reasonable costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, to persons granted an order under this subdivision.
(j) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the right of the corporation to obtain damages for any misuse of a membership list obtained under Section 6330, or otherwise, or to obtain injunctive relief necessary to restrain misuse of a member list. A corporation shall be entitled to recover reasonable costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, incurred in successfully bringing any such action.
(Amended by Stats. 1979, Ch. 724.)
6332.
  (a) Upon petition of the corporation or any member, the superior court of the proper county may limit or restrict the rights set forth in Section 6330 where, and only where such limitation or restriction is necessary to protect the rights of any member under the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution of the State of California. An order issued pursuant to this subdivision shall provide, insofar as possible, for alternative mechanisms by which the persons seeking to exercise rights under Section 6330 may communicate with members for purposes reasonably related to their interests as members.
(b) Upon the filing of a petition under subdivision (a), the court may, if requested by the person making the petition, issue a temporary order suspending the running of any time limit specified in Section 6330 for compliance with that section. Such an order may be extended, after notice and hearing, until final adjudication of the petition, wherever it appears that the petitioner may prevail on the merits, and it is otherwise equitable to do so.
(Added by Stats. 1978, Ch. 567.)
6333.
  The accounting books and records and minutes of proceedings of the members and the board and committees of the board shall be open to inspection upon the written demand on the corporation of any member at any reasonable time, for a purpose reasonably related to such person’s interests as a member.
(Added by Stats. 1978, Ch. 567.)
6334.
  Every director shall have the absolute right at any reasonable time to inspect and copy all books, records and documents of every kind and to inspect the physical properties of the corporation of which such person is a director.
(Added by Stats. 1978, Ch. 567.)
6335.
  Where the proper purpose of the person or persons making a demand pursuant to Section 6330 is frustrated by (1) any delay by the corporation in complying with a demand under Section 6330 beyond the time limits specified therein, or (2) any delay caused by the filing of a petition under Section 6331 or Section 6332, or (3) any delay caused by the alternative proposed under subdivision (c) of Section 6330, the person or persons properly making the demand shall have, in the discretion of the court, a right to obtain from the superior court an order postponing any members’ meeting previously noticed for a period equal to the period of such delay. The members may obtain such an order in a proceeding brought pursuant to Section 6331 upon the filing of a verified complaint in the proper county and after a hearing, notice of which shall be given to such persons and in such manner as the court may direct. Such right shall be in addition to any other legal or equitable remedies to which the member may be entitled.
(Amended by Stats. 1979, Ch. 724.)
6336.
  (a) Upon refusal of a lawful demand for inspection under this chapter, or a lawful demand pursuant to Section 6330 or Section 6333, the superior court of the proper county, or the county where the books or records in question are kept, may enforce the demand or right of inspection with just and proper conditions or may, for good cause shown, appoint one or more competent inspectors or independent accountants to audit the financial statements kept in this state and investigate the property, funds and affairs of any corporation and of any subsidiary corporation thereof, domestic or foreign, keeping records in this state and to report thereon in such manner as the court may direct.
(b) All officers and agents of the corporation shall produce to the inspectors or accountants so appointed all books and documents in their custody or power, under penalty of punishment for contempt of court.
(c) All expenses of the investigation or audit shall be defrayed by the applicant unless the court orders them to be paid or shared by the corporation.
(Amended by Stats. 1979, Ch. 724.)
6337.
  In any action or proceeding under this article, and except as required by Section 6331, if the court finds the failure of the corporation to comply with a proper demand thereunder was without justification, the court may award the member reasonable costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, in connection with such action or proceeding.
(Added by Stats. 1978, Ch. 567.)
6338.
  (a) A membership list is a corporate asset. Without consent of the board a membership list or any part thereof may not be obtained or used by any person for any purpose not reasonably related to a member’s interest as a member. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, without the consent of the board a membership list or any part thereof may not be:
(1) Used to solicit money or property unless such money or property will be used solely to solicit the vote of the members in an election to be held by their corporation.
(2) Used for any purpose which the user does not reasonably and in good faith believe will benefit the corporation.
(3) Used for any commercial purpose or purpose in competition with the corporation.
(4) Sold to or purchased by any person.
(b) Any person who violates the provisions of subdivision (a) shall be liable for any damage such violation causes the corporation and shall account for and pay to the corporation any profit derived as a result of such violation. In addition, a court in its discretion may award exemplary damages for a fraudulent or malicious violation of subdivision (a).
(c) Nothing in this article shall be construed to limit the right of a corporation to obtain injunctive relief necessary to restrain misuse of a membership list or any part thereof.
(d) In any action or proceeding under this section, a court may award the corporation reasonable costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, in connection with such action or proceeding.
(e) As used in this section, the term “membership list” means the record of the members’ names and addresses.

(1) One-half or more of the directors in office.
(2) A person or persons holding or authorized in writing by persons holding not less than 331/3 percent of the voting power exclusive of memberships held by persons who have personally participated in any of the transactions enumerated in paragraph (5) of subdivision (b).

(5) The Attorney General.
(6) The head organization under whose authority the corporation was created, where the corporation’s articles include the provision authorized by subdivision (a), paragraph (2), clause (i), of Section 5132.
(b) The grounds for involuntary dissolution are that:
(1) The corporation has abandoned its activity for more than one year.
(2) The corporation has an even number of directors who are equally divided and cannot agree as to the management of its affairs, so that its activities can no longer be conducted to advantage or so that there is danger that its property will be impaired or lost or its activities impaired and the members are so divided into factions that they cannot elect a board consisting of an uneven number.
(3) There is internal dissension and two or more factions of members in the corporation are so deadlocked that its activities can no longer be conducted with advantage.
(4) When during any four-year period or when all voting power has been exercised at two consecutive meetings or in two written ballots for the election of directors, whichever period is shorter, the members have failed to elect successors to directors whose terms have expired or would have expired upon election of their successors.
(5) Those in control of the corporation have been guilty of or have knowingly countenanced persistent and pervasive fraud, mismanagement or abuse of authority or the corporation’s property is being misapplied or wasted by its directors or officers.
(6) Liquidation is reasonably necessary as the corporation is failing and has continuously failed to carry out its purposes.
(7) The period for which the corporation was formed has terminated without extension of such period.

(d) In any action brought pursuant to subdivision (a), the Attorney General shall be an indispensable party.
(Amended by Stats. 1979, Ch. 724.)
6511.
  (a) The Attorney General may bring an action against any corporation or purported corporation in the name of the people of this state, upon the Attorney General’s own information or upon complaint of a private party, to procure a judgment dissolving the corporation and annulling, vacating or forfeiting its corporate existence upon any of the following grounds:
(1) The corporation has seriously offended against any provision of the statutes regulating corporations or charitable organizations.
(2) The corporation has fraudulently abused or usurped corporate privileges or powers.
(3) The corporation has violated any provision of law by any act or default which under the law is a ground for forfeiture of corporate existence.
(4) The corporation has failed to pay to the Franchise Tax Board for a period of five years any tax imposed upon it by the Bank and Corporation Tax Law.
(b) If the ground of the action is a matter or act which the corporation has done or omitted to do that can be corrected by amendment of its articles or by other corporate action, such suit shall not be maintained unless (1) the Attorney General, at least 30 days prior to the institution of suit, has given the corporation written notice of the matter or act done or omitted to be done and (2) the corporation has failed to institute proceedings to correct it within the 30-day period or thereafter fails to duly and properly make such amendment or take the corrective corporate action.
(c) In any such action the court may order dissolution or such other or partial relief as it deems just and expedient. The court also may appoint a receiver for winding up the affairs of the corporation or may order that the corporation be wound up by its board subject to the supervision of the court.

The Attorney General shall also publish one time in a newspaper of general circulation in the proper county a notice to the members of the corporation.
(Added by Stats. 1978, Ch. 567.)
6512.
  If the ground for the complaint for involuntary dissolution of the corporation is a deadlock in the board as set forth in paragraph (2) of subdivision (b) of Section 6510, the court may appoint a provisional director. The provisions of subdivision (e) of Section 5225 apply to any such provisional director so appointed.
(Added by Stats. 1978, Ch. 567.)
6513.
  If, at the time of the filing of a complaint for involuntary dissolution or at any time thereafter, the court has reasonable grounds to believe that unless a receiver of the corporation is appointed the interests of the corporation or the public or charitable purpose of the corporation will suffer pending the hearing and determination of the complaint, upon the application of the plaintiff, and after a hearing upon such notice to the corporation as the court may direct and upon the giving of security pursuant to Sections 566 and 567 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the court may appoint a receiver to take over and manage the affairs of the corporation and to preserve its property pending the hearing and determination of the complaint for dissolution.
(Amended by Stats. 1982, Ch. 517, Sec. 188.)
6514.
   After hearing the court may decree a winding up and dissolution of the corporation if cause therefor is shown or, with or without winding up and dissolution, may make such orders and decrees and issue such injunctions in the case as justice and equity require.
(Added by Stats. 1978, Ch. 567.)
6515.
  (a) Involuntary proceedings for winding up a corporation commence when the order for winding up is entered under Section 6514.
(b) When an involuntary proceeding for winding up has commenced, the board shall conduct the winding up of the affairs of the corporation, subject to the supervision of the court, unless other persons are appointed by the court, on good cause shown, to conduct the winding up. The directors or such other persons may, subject to any restrictions imposed by the court, exercise all their powers through the executive officers without any order of court.
(c) When an involuntary proceeding for winding up has commenced, the corporation shall cease to conduct its activities except to the extent necessary for the beneficial winding up thereof and except during such period as the board may deem necessary to preserve the corporation’s goodwill or going concern value, pending a sale or other disposition of its assets, or both, in whole or in part. The directors shall cause written notice of the commencement of the proceeding for involuntary winding up to be given by mail to all members and to all known creditors and claimants whose addresses appear on the records of the corporation, unless the order for winding up has been stayed by appeal therefrom or otherwise or the proceeding or the execution of the order has been enjoined.
(Added by Stats. 1978, Ch. 567.)
6516.
  When an involuntary proceeding for winding up has been commenced, the jurisdiction of the court includes:
(a) The requirement of the proof of all claims and demands against the corporation, whether due or not yet due, contingent, unliquidated or sounding only in damages, and the barring from participation of creditors and claimants failing to make and present claims and proof as required by any order.
(b) The determination or compromise of all claims of every nature against the corporation or any of its property, and the determination of the amount of money or assets required to be retained to pay or provide for the payment of claims.

(e) The filling of any vacancies on the board which the directors or members are unable to fill.
(f) The removal of any director if it appears that the director has been guilty of dishonesty, misconduct, neglect or breach of trust in conducting the winding up or if the director is unable to act. The court may order an election to fill the vacancy so caused, and may enjoin, for such time as it considers proper, the reelection of the director so removed; or the court, in lieu of ordering an election, may appoint a director to fill the vacancy caused by such removal. Any director so appointed by the court shall serve until the next regular meeting of members or until a successor is elected or appointed.
(g) The staying of the prosecution of any suit, proceeding or action against the corporation and requiring the parties to present and prove their claims in the manner required of other creditors.

(k) The making of orders for the bringing in of new parties as the court deems proper for the determination of all questions and matters.
(l) The disposition of assets held in charitable trust.
(Added by Stats. 1978, Ch. 567.)
6517.
  (a) All creditors and claimants may be barred from participation in any distribution of the general assets if they fail to make and present claims and proofs within such time as the court may direct, which shall not be less than four nor more than six months after the first publication of notice to creditors unless it appears by affidavit that there are no claims, in which case the time limit may be three months. If it is shown that a claimant did not receive notice because of absence from the state or other cause, the court may allow a claim to be filed or presented at any time before distribution is completed.
(b) Such notice to creditors shall be published not less than once a week for three consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation published in the county in which the proceeding is pending or, if there is no such newspaper published in that county, in such newspaper as may be designated by the court, directing creditors and claimants to make and present claims and proofs to the person, at the place and within the time specified in the notice. A copy of the notice shall be mailed to each person shown as a creditor or claimant on the books of the corporation, at such person’s last known address.
(c) Holders of secured claims may prove for the whole debt in order to realize any deficiency. If such creditors fail to present their claims they shall be barred only as to any right to claim against the general assets for any deficiency in the amount realized on their security.
(d) Before any distribution is made the amount of any unmatured, contingent or disputed claim against the corporation which has been presented and has not been disallowed, or such part of any such claim as the holder would be entitled to if the claim were due, established or absolute, shall be paid into court and there remain to be paid over to the party when the party becomes entitled thereto or, if the party fails to establish a claim, to be paid over or distributed with the other assets of the corporation to those entitled thereto; or such other provision for the full payment of such claim, if and when established, shall be made as the court may deem adequate. A creditor whose claim has been allowed but is not yet due shall be entitled to its present value upon distribution.
(e) Suits against the corporation on claims which have been rejected shall be commenced within 30 days after written notice of rejection thereof is given to the claimant.

The order shall declare:
(1) That the corporation has been duly wound up, that a final franchise tax return, as described by Section 23332 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, has been filed with the Franchise Tax Board, as required under Part 10.2 (commencing with Section 18401) of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code and that its known debts and liabilities have been paid or adequately provided for, or that those debts and liabilities have been paid as far as its assets permitted, as the case may be. If there are known debts or liabilities for payment of which adequate provision has been made, the order shall state what provision has been made, setting forth the name and address of the corporation, person or governmental agency that has assumed or guaranteed the payment, or the name and address of the depositary with which deposit has been made or such other information as may be necessary to enable the creditor or other person to whom payment is to be made to appear and claim payment of the debt or liability.
(2) That its known assets have been distributed to the persons entitled thereto or that it acquired no known assets, as the case may be.
(3) That the accounts of directors or such other persons have been settled and that they are discharged from their duties and liabilities to creditors and members.

(c) The court may make such additional orders and grant such further relief as it deems proper upon the evidence submitted.
(d) Upon the making of the order declaring the corporation dissolved, corporate existence shall cease except for the purposes of further winding up if needed; and the directors or such other persons shall be discharged from their duties and liabilities, except as otherwise ordered by the court and in respect to completion of the winding up.

(B) Each director is provided the means of participating in all matters before the board, including, without limitation, the capacity to propose, or to interpose an objection to, a specific action to be taken by the corporation.
(7) A majority of the number of directors authorized in or pursuant to the articles or bylaws constitutes a quorum of the board for the transaction of business. The articles or bylaws may require the presence of one or more specified directors in order to constitute a quorum of the board to transact business, as long as the death or nonexistence of a specified director or the death or 				 nonexistence of the person or persons otherwise authorized to appoint or designate that director does not prevent the corporation from transacting business in the normal course of events. The articles or bylaws may not provide that a quorum shall be less than one-fifth the number of directors authorized in or pursuant to the articles or bylaws, or less than two, whichever is larger, unless the number of directors authorized in or pursuant to the articles or bylaws is one, in which case one director constitutes a quorum.
(8) Subject to the provisions of Sections 7212, 7233, 7234, and subdivision (e) of Section 7237 and Section 5233, insofar as it is made applicable pursuant to Section 7238, an act or decision done or made by a majority of the directors present at a meeting duly held at which a quorum is present is the act of the board. The articles or bylaws may not provide that a lesser vote than a majority of the directors present at a meeting 				 is the act of the board. A meeting at which a quorum is initially present may continue to transact business notwithstanding the withdrawal of directors, if any action taken is approved by at least a majority of the required quorum for that meeting, or a greater number required by this division, the articles or the bylaws.
(b) An action required or permitted to be taken by the board may be taken without a meeting if all directors individually or collectively consent in writing to that action and if, subject to subdivision (a) of Section 7224, the number of directors then in office constitutes a quorum. The written consent or consents shall be filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the board. The action by written consent shall have the same force and effect as a unanimous vote of the directors. For purposes of this subdivision only, “all directors” does not include an “interested director” as defined in subdivision (a) of Section 5233, 				 insofar as it is made applicable pursuant to Section 7238 or described in subdivision (a) of Section 7233, or a “common director” as described in subdivision (b) of Section 7233 who abstains in writing from providing consent, where (1) the facts described in paragraph (2) or (3) of subdivision (d) of Section 5233 are established or the provisions of paragraph (1) or (2) of subdivision (a) of Section 7233 or in paragraph (1) or (2) of subdivision (b) of Section 7233 are satisfied, as appropriate, at or prior to execution of the written consent or consents; (2) the establishment of those facts or satisfaction of those provisions, as applicable, is included in the written consent or consents executed by the noninterested directors or noncommon directors or in other records of the corporation; and (3) the noninterested directors or noncommon directors, as applicable, approve the action by a vote that is sufficient without counting the votes of the interested directors or common directors.
(c) Each director shall have one vote on each matter presented to the board of directors for action. A director shall not vote by proxy.
(d) This section applies also to incorporators, to committees of the board, and to action by those incorporators or committees mutatis mutandis.

7212.
  (a) The board may, by resolution adopted by a majority of the number of directors then in office, provided that a quorum is present, create one or more committees, each consisting of two or more directors, to serve at the pleasure of the board. Appointments to such committees shall be by a majority vote of the directors then in office, unless the articles or bylaws require a majority vote of the number of directors authorized in or pursuant to the articles or bylaws. The bylaws may authorize one or more such committees, each consisting of two or more directors, and may provide that a specified officer or officers who are also directors of the corporation shall be a member or members of such committee or committees. The board may appoint one or more directors as alternate members of such 				 committee, who may replace any absent member at any meeting of the committee. Such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the board or in the bylaws, shall have all the authority of the board, except with respect to:
(1) The approval of any action for which this part also requires approval of the members (Section 5034) or approval of a majority of all members (Section 5033), regardless of whether the corporation has members.
(2) The filling of vacancies on the board or in any committee which has the authority of the board.
(3) The fixing of compensation of the directors for serving on the board or on any committee.
(4) The amendment or repeal of bylaws or the adoption of new bylaws.
(5) The amendment or repeal of any resolution of the board which by its express terms is not so amendable or repealable.
(6) The appointment of committees of the board or the members thereof.

(8) With respect to any assets held in charitable trust, the approval of any self-dealing transaction except as provided in paragraph (3) of subdivision (d) of Section 5233.
(b) A committee exercising the authority of the board shall not include as members persons who are not directors. However, the board may create other committees that do not exercise the authority of the board and these other committees may 				 include persons regardless of whether they are directors.
(c) Unless the bylaws otherwise provide, the board may delegate to any committee, appointed pursuant to paragraph (4) of subdivision (c) of Section 7151 or otherwise, powers as authorized by Section 7210, but may not delegate the powers set forth in paragraphs (1) to (8), inclusive, of subdivision (a).
(Amended by Stats. 2011, Ch. 442, Sec. 15. (AB 1211) Effective January 1, 2012.)
7213.
  (a) A corporation shall have (1) a chair of the board, who may be given the title chair, chairperson, chair of the board, or chairperson of the board, or a president or both, (2) a secretary, (3) a treasurer or a chief financial officer or both, and (4) any other officers with any titles and duties as shall be stated in the bylaws or determined by the board and as may be necessary to enable it to sign instruments. The president, or if there is no president the chair of the board, is the general manager and chief executive officer of the corporation, unless otherwise provided in the articles or bylaws. Unless otherwise specified in the articles or the bylaws, if there is no chief financial officer, the treasurer is the chief financial officer of 						the corporation. Any number of offices may be held by the same person unless the articles or bylaws provide otherwise. Where a corporation holds assets in charitable trust, any compensation of the president or chief executive officer and the chief financial officer or treasurer shall be determined in accordance with subdivision (g) of Section 12586 of the Government Code, if applicable.
(b) Except as otherwise provided by the articles or bylaws, officers shall be chosen by the board and serve at the pleasure of the board, subject to the rights, if any, of an officer under any contract of employment. Any officer may resign at any time upon written notice to the corporation without prejudice to the rights, if any, of the corporation under any contract to which the officer is a party.
(Amended by Stats. 2022, Ch. 617, Sec. 57. (SB 1202) Effective January 1, 2023.)
7214.
  Subject to the provisions of subdivision (a) of Section 7141 and Section 7142, any note, mortgage, evidence of indebtedness, contract, conveyance or other instrument in writing, and any assignment or endorsement thereof, executed or entered into between any corporation and any other person, when signed by any one of the chairperson of the board, the president or any vice president and by any one of the secretary, any assistant secretary, the chief financial officer, or any assistant treasurer of such corporation, is not invalidated as to the corporation by any lack of authority of the signing officers in the absence of actual knowledge on the part of the other person that the signing officers had no authority to execute the 						same.
(Amended by Stats. 2022, Ch. 617, Sec. 58. (SB 1202) Effective January 1, 2023.)
7215.
  The original or a copy in writing or in any other form capable of being converted into clearly legible tangible form of the bylaws or of the minutes of any incorporators’, members’, directors’, committee or other meeting or of any resolution adopted by the board or a committee thereof, or members, certified to be a true copy by a person purporting to be the secretary or an assistant secretary of the corporation, is prima facie evidence of the adoption of such bylaws or resolution or of the due holding of such meeting and of the matters stated therein.
(Amended by Stats. 2004, Ch. 254, Sec. 23. Effective January 1, 2005.)
ARTICLE 2. Selection, Removal and Resignation of Directors [7220 - 7225]  ( Article 2 added by Stats. 1978, Ch. 567. )

7220.
  (a) Except as provided in subdivision (d), (e), or (f), directors shall be elected for terms of not longer than four years, as fixed in the articles or bylaws. However, the terms of directors of a corporation without members may be up to six years. In the absence of any provision in the articles or bylaws, the term shall be one year. The articles or bylaws may provide for staggering the terms of directors by dividing the total number of directors into groups of one or more directors. The terms of office of the several groups and the number of directors in each group need not be uniform. No amendment of the articles or bylaws may extend the term of a director beyond that for which the director was elected, nor may any bylaw provision increasing 						the terms of directors be adopted without approval of the members (Section 5034).
(b) Except as otherwise provided in the articles or bylaws, each director, including a director elected to fill a vacancy, shall hold office until the expiration of the term for which elected and until a successor has been elected and qualified, unless the director has been removed from office.
(c) The articles or bylaws may provide for the election of one or more directors by the members of any class voting as a class.
(d) For the purposes of this subdivision, “designator” means one or more designators. Notwithstanding subdivisions (a) to (c), inclusive, all or any portion of the directors authorized in the articles or bylaws of a corporation 						may hold office by virtue of designation or selection by a specified designator as provided by the articles or bylaws rather than by election. Those directors shall continue in office for the term prescribed by the governing article or bylaw provision, or, if there is no term prescribed, until the governing article or bylaw provision is duly amended or repealed, except as provided in subdivision (e) of Section 7222. A bylaw provision authorized by this subdivision may be adopted, amended, or repealed only by approval of the members (Section 5034), except as provided in subdivision (d) of Section 7150. Unless otherwise provided in the articles or bylaws, the entitlement to designate or select a director or directors shall cease if any of the following circumstances exist:
(1) The specified designator of that director or directors has died 						or ceased to exist.
(2) If the entitlement of the specified designator of that director or directors to designate is in the capacity of an officer, trustee, or other status and the office, trust, or status has ceased to exist.
(e) If a corporation has not issued memberships and (1) all the directors resign, die, or become incompetent, or (2) a corporation’s initial directors have not been named in the articles and all incorporators resign, die, or become incompetent before the election of the initial directors, the superior court of any county may appoint directors of the corporation upon application by any party in interest.
(f) If authorized in the articles or bylaws of a corporation, all or any portion of the 						directors may hold office ex officio by virtue of occupying a specified position within the corporation or outside the corporation. The term of office of an ex officio director shall coincide with that director’s respective term of office in the specified position entitling him or her to serve on the board of directors. Upon an ex officio director’s resignation or removal from that position, or resignation or removal from the board for any reason, the term of office as a director of the corporation shall immediately cease. At that time, the successor in office shall become an ex officio director of the corporation, occupying the place of the former director.
(Amended by Stats. 2018, Ch. 322, Sec. 3. (AB 2557) Effective January 1, 2019.)
7221.
  (a) The board may declare vacant the office of a director who has been declared of unsound mind by a final order of court, or convicted of a felony, or, in the case of a corporation holding assets in charitable trust, has been found by a final order or judgment of any court to have breached any duty arising as a result of Section 7238, or, if at the time a director is elected, the bylaws provide that a director may be removed for missing a specified number of board meetings, fails to attend the specified number of meetings.
(b) As provided in paragraph (3) of subdivision (c) of Section 7151, the articles or bylaws may prescribe the qualifications of the directors. The board, by a majority vote of the directors who meet all of the required qualifications to be a director, may declare vacant the office of any director who fails or ceases to meet any required qualification that was in effect at the beginning of that director’s current term of office.
(Amended by Stats. 1996, Ch. 589, Sec. 26. Effective January 1, 1997.)

(2) In a corporation with 50 or more members, the removal is approved by the members (Section 5034).
(3) In a corporation with no members, the removal is approved by a majority of the directors then in office.
(b) Except for a corporation having no members, pursuant to Section 7310:
(1) In a corporation in which the articles or bylaws authorize members to cumulate their votes pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 7615, no director may be removed (unless the entire board is removed) when the votes cast against removal, or not consenting in writing to the removal, would be sufficient to elect the director if voted cumulatively at an election at which the same total number of votes were cast (or, if the action is taken by written ballot, all memberships entitled to vote were voted) and the entire number of directors authorized at the time of the director’s most recent election were then being elected.
(2) When by the provisions of the articles or bylaws the members of any class, voting as a class, are entitled to elect one or more directors, any director so elected may be removed only by the applicable vote of the members of that class.
(3) When by the provisions of the articles or bylaws the members within a chapter or other organizational unit, or region or other geographic grouping, voting as such, are entitled to elect one or more directors, any director so elected may be removed only by the applicable vote of the members within the organizational unit or geographic grouping.
(c) Any reduction of the authorized number of directors or any amendment reducing the number of classes of directors does not remove any director prior to the expiration of the director’s term of office unless the reduction or amendment also provides for the removal of one or more specified directors.
(d) Except as provided in this section and Sections 7221 and 7223, a director may not be removed prior to the expiration of the director’s term of office.
(e) Where a director removed under this section or Section 7221 or 7223 was chosen by designation pursuant to subdivision (d) of Section 7220, then:
(1) Where a different person may be designated pursuant to the governing article or bylaw provision, the new designation shall be made.
(2) Where the governing article or bylaw provision contains no provision under which a different person may be designated, the governing article or bylaw provision shall be deemed repealed.
(f) For the purposes of this subdivision, “designator” means one or more designators. If by the provisions of the articles or bylaws a designator is entitled to designate one or more directors, then:
(1) Unless otherwise 				 provided in the articles or bylaws at the time of designation, any director so designated may be removed without cause by the designator of that director.
(2) Any director so designated may only be removed under subdivision (a) with the written consent of the designator of that director.
(3) Unless otherwise provided in the articles or bylaws, the right to remove shall not apply if any of the following circumstances exist:
(A) The designator entitled to that right has died or ceased to exist.
(B) If that right is in the capacity of an officer, trustee, or other status, and the office, trust, or status has ceased to exist.
(Amended by Stats. 2009, Ch. 631, Sec. 23. (AB 1233) Effective January 1, 2010.)
7223.
  (a) The superior court of the proper county may, at the suit of one of the parties specified in subdivision (b), remove from office any director in case of fraudulent or dishonest acts or gross abuse of authority or discretion with reference to the corporation or breach of any duty arising as a result of Section 7238 and may bar from reelection any director so removed for a period prescribed by the court. The corporation shall be made a party to such action.
(b) An action under subdivision (a) may be instituted by any of the following:
(1) A director.
(2) In the case of a corporation where the total number of votes entitled to be cast for a director is less than 5,000, twice the authorized number (Section 5036) of members, or 20 members, whichever is less.
(3) In the case of a corporation where the total number of votes entitled to be cast for a director is 5,000 or more, twice the authorized number (Section 5036) of members, or 100 members, whichever is less.
(c) In the case of a corporation holding assets in charitable trust, the Attorney General may bring an action under subdivision (a), may intervene in such an action brought by any other party and shall be given notice of any such action brought by any other party.
(Amended by Stats. 1981, Ch. 587, Sec. 29.)
7224.
  (a) Unless otherwise provided in the articles or bylaws and except for a vacancy created by the removal of a director, vacancies on the board may be filled by approval of the board (Section 5032) or, if the number of directors then in office is less than a quorum, by (1) the unanimous written consent of the directors then in office, (2) the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office at a meeting held pursuant to notice or waivers of notice complying with Section 7211, or (3) a sole remaining director. Unless the articles or a bylaw approved by the members (Section 5034) provide that the board may fill vacancies occurring in the board by reason of the removal of directors, or unless the 						corporation has no members pursuant to Section 7310, such vacancies may be filled only by approval of the members (Section 5034).
(b) The members may elect a director at any time to fill any vacancy not filled by the directors.
(c) Any director may resign effective upon giving written notice to the chairperson of the board, the president, the secretary, or the board of directors of the corporation, unless the notice specifies a later time for the effectiveness of such resignation.

(Amended by Stats. 2022, Ch. 617, Sec. 59. (SB 1202) Effective January 1, 2023.)
7225.
  (a) If a corporation has an even number of directors who are equally divided and cannot agree as to the management of its affairs, so that its activities can no longer be conducted to advantage or so that there is danger that its property, activities, or business will be impaired or lost, the superior court of the proper county may, notwithstanding any provisions of the articles or bylaws and whether or not an action is pending for an involuntary winding up or dissolution of the corporation, appoint a provisional director pursuant to this section. Action for such appointment may be brought by any director or by members holding not less than 331/3 percent of the voting power.
(b) If the members of a corporation are deadlocked so that they cannot elect the directors to be elected at the time prescribed therefor, the superior court of the proper county may, notwithstanding any provisions of the articles or bylaws, upon petition of members holding 50 percent of the voting power, appoint a provisional director or directors pursuant to this section or order such other equitable relief as the court deems appropriate.
(c) In the case of a corporation holding assets in charitable trust:

A provisional director shall have all the rights and powers of a director until the deadlock in the board or among members is broken or until such provisional director is removed by order of the court or by approval of a majority of all members (Section 5033). Such person shall be entitled to such compensation as shall be fixed by the court unless otherwise agreed with the corporation.

7231.
  (a) A director shall perform the duties of a director, including duties as a member of any committee of the board upon which the director may serve, in good faith, in a manner such director believes to be in the best interests of the corporation and with such care, including reasonable inquiry, as an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances.

(c) A person who performs the duties of a director in 				 accordance with subdivisions (a) and (b) shall have no liability based upon any alleged failure to discharge the person’s obligations as a director, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any actions or omissions which exceed or defeat a public or charitable purpose to which assets held by a corporation are dedicated.
(Amended by Stats. 2009, Ch. 631, Sec. 24. (AB 1233) Effective January 1, 2010.)

(1) The duties are performed in good faith.
(2) The duties are performed in a manner such director or officer believes to be in the best interests of the corporation.
(3) The duties are performed with such care, including reasonable inquiry, as an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances.

7233.
  (a) No contract or other transaction between a corporation and one or more of its directors, or between a corporation and any domestic or foreign corporation, firm or association in which one or more of its directors has a material financial interest, is either void or voidable because such director or directors or such other corporation, business corporation, firm or association are parties or because such director or directors are present at the meeting of the board or a committee thereof which authorizes, approves or ratifies the contract or transaction, if:
(1) The material facts as to the transaction and as to such director’s interest are fully disclosed or known to the members and such contract or transaction is approved by the members (Section 5034) in good faith, with any membership owned by any interested director not being entitled to vote thereon;
(2) The material facts as to the transaction and as to such director’s interest are fully disclosed or known to the board or committee, and the board or committee authorizes, approves or ratifies the contract or transaction in good faith by a vote sufficient without counting the vote of the interested director or directors and the contract or transaction is just and reasonable as to the corporation at the time it is authorized, approved or ratified; or
(3) As to contracts or transactions not approved as provided in paragraph (1) or (2) of this subdivision, the person asserting the validity of the contract or transaction sustains the burden of proving that the contract or transaction was just and reasonable as to the corporation at the time it was authorized, approved or ratified.
A mere common directorship does not constitute a material financial interest within the meaning of this subdivision. A director is not interested within the meaning of this subdivision in a resolution fixing the compensation of another director as a director, officer or employee of the corporation, notwithstanding the fact that the first director is also receiving compensation from the corporation.
(b) No contract or other transaction between a corporation and any corporation, business corporation or association of which one or more of its directors are directors is either void or voidable because such director or directors are present at the meeting of the board or a committee thereof which authorizes, approves or ratifies the contract or transaction, if:
(1) The material facts as to the transaction and as to such director’s other directorship are fully disclosed or known to the board or committee, and the board or committee authorizes, approves or ratifies the contract or transaction in good faith by a vote sufficient without counting the vote of the common director or directors or the contract or transaction is approved by the members (Section 5034) in good faith; or
(2) As to contracts or transactions not approved as provided in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, the contract or transaction is just and reasonable as to the corporation at the time it is authorized, approved or ratified.
This subdivision does not apply to contracts or transactions covered by subdivision (a).

(Added by Stats. 1978, Ch. 567.)
7235.
  (a) Unless prohibited by the articles or bylaws, a corporation may loan money or property to, or guarantee the obligation of, any director or officer of the corporation or of its parent, affiliate or subsidiary, provided:
(1) The board determines the loan or guaranty may reasonably be expected to benefit the corporation.
(2) Prior to consummating the transaction or any part thereof, the loan or guaranty is either:
(A) Approved by the members (Section 5034), without counting the vote of the director or officer, if a member, or
(B) Approved by the vote of a majority of the directors then in office, without counting the vote of the director who is to receive the loan or the benefit of the guaranty.
(b) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), a corporation may advance money to a director or officer of the corporation or of its parent, affiliate or subsidiary, for any expenses reasonably anticipated to be incurred in the performance of the duties of the director or officer of the corporation or of its parent, affiliate or subsidiary, provided that in the absence of such an advance the director or officer would be entitled to be reimbursed for these expenses by the corporation, its parent, affiliate, or subsidiary.
(c) The provisions of subdivisions (a) and (b) do not apply to credit unions, or to the payment of premiums in whole or in part by a corporation on a life insurance policy on the life of a director or officer so long as repayment to the corporation of the amount paid by it is secured by the proceeds of the policy and its cash surrender value, or to loans permitted under any statute regulating any special class of corporations.

(1) The making of any distribution contrary to Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 7410).
(2) The distribution of assets after institution of dissolution proceedings of the corporation, without paying or adequately providing for all known liabilities of the corporation, excluding any claims not filed by creditors within the time limit set by the court in a notice given to creditors under Chapter 15 (commencing with Section 8510), Chapter 16 (commencing with Section 8610), and Chapter 17 (commencing with Section 8710).
(3) The making of any loan or guaranty contrary to Section 7235.
(b) A director who is present at a meeting of the board, or any committee thereof, at which an action specified in subdivision (a) is taken and who abstains from voting shall be considered to have approved the action.

7237.
  (a) For purposes of this section, “agent” means a person who is or was a director, officer, employee, or other agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee, or agent of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of a foreign or domestic corporation that was a predecessor corporation of the corporation or of another enterprise at the request of the predecessor corporation; “proceeding” means any threatened, pending, or completed action or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative; and “expenses” includes, without limitation, attorneys’ fees and any expenses of establishing a right to indemnification under subdivision (d) or paragraph (3) 				 of subdivision (e).
(b) A corporation shall have power to indemnify a person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any proceeding (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor, an action brought under Section 5233 of Part 2 (commencing with Section 5110) made applicable pursuant to Section 7238, or an action brought by the Attorney General or a person granted relator status by the Attorney General for any breach of duty relating to assets held in charitable trust) by reason of the fact that the person is or was an agent of the corporation, against expenses, judgments, fines, settlements, and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with the proceeding if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the corporation and, in the case of a criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe 				 the conduct of the person was unlawful. The termination of any proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which the person reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the corporation or that the person had reasonable cause to believe that the person’s conduct was unlawful.
(c) A corporation shall have power to indemnify a person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending, or completed action by or in the right of the corporation, or brought under Section 5233 of Part 2 (commencing with Section 5110) made applicable pursuant to Section 7238, or brought by the Attorney General or a person granted relator status by the Attorney General for breach of duty relating to assets held in charitable trust, to procure a judgment in its favor by 				 reason of the fact that the person is or was an agent of the corporation, against expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with the defense or settlement of the action if the person acted in good faith, in a manner the person believed to be in the best interests of the corporation and with such care, including reasonable inquiry, as an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances. No indemnification shall be made under this subdivision:
(1) With respect to any claim, issue, or matter as to which the person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation in the performance of the person’s duty to the corporation, unless and only to the extent that the court in which the proceeding is or was pending shall determine upon application that, in view of all the circumstances of the case, the person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for the expenses which the court 				 shall determine;
(2) Of amounts paid in settling or otherwise disposing of a threatened or pending action, with or without court approval; or
(3) Of expenses incurred in defending a threatened or pending action that is settled or otherwise disposed of without court approval unless the action concerns assets held in charitable trust and is settled with the approval of the Attorney General.
(d) To the extent that an agent of a corporation has been successful on the merits in defense of any proceeding referred to in subdivision (b) or (c) or in defense of any claim, issue, or matter therein, the agent shall be indemnified against expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the agent in connection therewith.
(e) Except as provided in subdivision (d), any 				 indemnification under this section shall be made by the corporation only if authorized in the specific case, upon a determination that indemnification of the agent is proper in the circumstances because the agent has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in subdivision (b) or (c), by:
(1) A majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who are not parties to the proceeding;
(2) Approval of the members (Section 5034), with the persons to be indemnified not being entitled to vote thereon; or
(3) The court in which the proceeding is or was pending upon application made by the corporation or the agent or the attorney, or other person rendering services in connection with the defense, whether or not the application by the agent, attorney or other person is opposed by the corporation.
(f) Expenses incurred in defending any proceeding may be advanced by the corporation before the final disposition of the proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the agent to repay the amount unless it shall be determined ultimately that the agent is entitled to be indemnified as authorized in this section. The provisions of subdivision (a) of Section 7235 do not apply to advances made pursuant to this subdivision.
(g) A provision made by a corporation to indemnify its or its subsidiary’s directors or officers for the defense of any proceeding, whether contained in the articles, bylaws, a resolution of members or directors, an agreement, or otherwise, shall not be valid unless consistent with this section. Nothing contained in this section shall affect any right to indemnification to which persons other than the directors and officers may be entitled by contract 				 or otherwise.
(h) No indemnification or advance shall be made under this section, except as provided in subdivision (d) or paragraph (3) of subdivision (e), in any circumstance where it appears:
(1) That it would be inconsistent with a provision of the articles, bylaws, a resolution of the members, or an agreement in effect at the time of the accrual of the alleged cause of action asserted in the proceeding in which the expenses were incurred or other amounts were paid, which prohibits or otherwise limits indemnification; or
(2) That it would be inconsistent with any condition expressly imposed by a court in approving a settlement.
(i) A corporation shall have power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of an agent of the corporation against any 				 liability asserted against or incurred by the agent in that capacity or arising out of the agent’s status as such whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify the agent against that liability under the provisions of this section.
(j) This section does not apply to any proceeding against a trustee, investment manager, or other fiduciary of a pension, deferred compensation, saving, thrift, or other retirement, incentive, or benefit plan, trust, or provision for any or all of the corporation’s directors, officers, employees, and persons providing services to the corporation or any of its subsidiary or related or affiliated corporations, in that person’s capacity as such, even though the person may also be an agent as defined in subdivision (a) of the employer corporation. A corporation shall have power to indemnify the trustee, investment manager, or other fiduciary to the extent permitted by subdivision (e) of Section 				 7140.

(2) If there are restrictions upon the transferability, a statement that a copy of the restrictions are on file with the secretary of the corporation and are open for inspection by a member on the same basis as the records of the corporation.

(b) This section shall not relieve the resigning member from any obligation for charges incurred, services or benefits actually rendered, dues, assessments or fees, or arising from contract, a condition to ownership of land, an obligation arising out of the ownership of land, or otherwise, and this section shall not diminish any right of the corporation to enforce any such obligation or obtain damages for its breach.

(b) Any expulsion, suspension, or termination must be done in good faith and in a fair and reasonable manner. Any procedure which conforms to the requirements of subdivision (c) is fair and reasonable, but a court may also find other procedures to be fair and reasonable when the full circumstances of the suspension, termination, or expulsion are considered.
(c) A procedure is fair and reasonable when:
(1) The provisions of the procedure have been set forth in the articles or bylaws, or copies of such provisions are sent annually to all the members as required by the articles or bylaws;
(2) It provides the giving of 15 days’ prior notice of the expulsion, suspension or termination and the reasons therefor; and
(3) It provides an opportunity for the member to be heard, orally or in writing, not less than five days before the effective date of the expulsion, suspension or termination by a person or body authorized to decide that the proposed expulsion, termination or suspension not take place.
(d) Any notice required under this section may be given by any method reasonably calculated to provide actual notice. Any notice given by mail must be given by first-class or registered mail sent to the last address of the members shown on the corporation’s records.
(e) Any action challenging an expulsion, suspension or termination of membership, including any claim alleging defective notice, must be commenced within one year after the date of the expulsion, suspension or termination. In the event such an action is successful the court may order any relief, including reinstatement, it finds equitable under the circumstances, but no vote of the members or of the board may be set aside solely because a person was at the time of the vote wrongfully excluded by virtue of the challenged expulsion, suspension or termination, unless the court finds further that the wrongful expulsion, suspension or termination was in bad faith and for the purpose, and with the effect, of wrongfully excluding the member from the vote or from the meeting at which the vote took place, so as to affect the outcome of the vote.
(f) This section governs only the procedures for expulsion, suspension or termination and not the substantive grounds therefor. An expulsion, suspension or termination based upon substantive grounds which violate contractual or other rights of the member or are otherwise unlawful is not made valid by compliance with this section.
(g) A member who is expelled or suspended or whose membership is terminated shall be liable for any charges incurred, services or benefits actually rendered, dues, assessments or fees incurred before the expulsion, suspension or termination or arising from contract or otherwise.

  (a) A member of a corporation is not, as such, personally liable for the debts, liabilities, or obligations of the corporation.
(b) No person is liable for any obligation arising from membership unless the person was admitted to membership upon the person’s application or with the person’s consent.
(c) The ownership of an interest in real property, when a condition of its ownership is membership in a corporation, shall be considered consent to such membership for the purpose of this section.
(Added by Stats. 1978, Ch. 567.)
7351.
  A corporation may levy dues, assessments, or fees upon its members pursuant to its articles or bylaws, but a member upon learning of them may avoid liability for them by promptly resigning from membership, except where the member is liable for them by contract, as a condition to ownership of an interest in real property, as an obligation arising out of the ownership of an interest in real property, or otherwise. Article or bylaw provisions authorizing such dues, assessments or fees do not, of themselves, create such liability.
(Amended by Stats. 1979, Ch. 724.)
7352.
  A person holding a membership as pledgee or a membership as executor, administrator, guardian, trustee, receiver or in any representative or fiduciary capacity is not personally liable for any unpaid balance of the purchase price of the membership, or for any amount owing to the corporation by the member, because the membership is so held, but the estate and funds in the hands of such fiduciary or representative are liable and the membership subject to sale therefor.
(Amended by Stats. 1983, Ch. 1085, Sec. 5.1.)
7353.
  (a) No action shall be brought by or on behalf of any creditor to reach and apply the liability, if any, of a member to the corporation to pay the amount due on such member’s membership or otherwise due to the corporation unless final judgment has been rendered in favor of the creditor against the corporation and execution has been returned unsatisfied in whole or in part or unless such proceedings would be useless.
(b) All creditors of the corporation, with or without reducing their claims to judgment, may intervene in any such creditor’s action to reach and apply unpaid amounts due the corporation and any or all members who owe amounts to the corporation may be joined in such action. Several judgments may be rendered for and against the parties to the action or in favor of a receiver for the benefit of the respective parties thereto.
(c) All amounts paid by any member in any such action shall be credited on the unpaid balance due the corporation by such member.
(Added by Stats. 1978, Ch. 567.)
7354.
  Nothing in this part shall be construed as in derogation of any rights or remedies which any creditor or member may have against any promoter, member, director, officer or the corporation because of participation in any fraud or illegality practiced upon such creditor or member by any such person or by the corporation in connection with the issue or sale of memberships or securities or in derogation of any rights which the corporation may have by rescission, cancellation or otherwise because of any fraud or illegality practiced on it by any such person in connection with the issue or sale of memberships or securities.

7413.
  Neither a corporation nor any of its subsidiaries shall purchase or redeem a membership of the parent or subsidiary if the articles of the corporation contain a provision authorized by subparagraph (B) of paragraph (4) of subdivision (a) of Section 7132 and such corporation or the subsidiary making the purchase or redemption is, or as a result thereof would be, likely to be unable to meet the obligations resulting from such article provision.

(c) If a corporation with members is required by subdivision (b) to hold a regular meeting and fails to hold the regular meeting for a period of 60 days after the date designated therefor or, if no date has been designated, for a period of 15 months after the formation of the 						corporation or after its last regular meeting, or if the corporation fails to hold a written ballot for a period of 60 days after the date designated therefor, then the superior court of the proper county may summarily order the meeting to be held or the ballot to be conducted upon the application of a member or the Attorney General, after notice to the corporation giving it an opportunity to be heard.
(d) The votes represented, either in person (or, if proxies are allowed, by proxy), at a meeting called or by written ballot ordered pursuant to subdivision (c), and entitled to be cast on the business to be transacted shall constitute a quorum, notwithstanding any provision of the articles or bylaws or in this part to the contrary. The court may issue such orders as may be appropriate including, without limitation, orders designating the 						time and place of the meeting, the record date for determination of members entitled to vote, and the form of notice of the meeting.
(e) Special meetings of members for any lawful purpose may be called by the board, the chairperson of the board, the president, or such other persons, if any, as are specified in the bylaws. In addition, special meetings of members for any lawful purpose may be called by 5 percent or more of the members.
(f) A meeting of the members may be conducted, in whole or in part, by electronic transmission by and to the corporation, electronic video screen communication, conference telephone, or other means of remote communication if the corporation implements reasonable measures: (1) to provide members and proxyholders, if proxies are allowed, a reasonable 						opportunity to participate in the meeting and to vote on matters submitted to the members, including an opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of the meeting substantially concurrently with those proceedings, (2) if any member or proxyholder, if proxies are allowed, votes or takes other action at the meeting by means of electronic 						transmission to the corporation, electronic video screen communication, conference telephone, or other means of remote communication, to maintain a record of that vote or action in its books and records, and (3) to verify that each person participating remotely is a member or proxyholder, if proxies are allowed. A corporation shall not conduct a meeting of members solely by electronic transmission by and to the corporation, electronic video screen communication, conference telephone, or other means of remote communication unless one or more of the following conditions apply: (A) all of the members consent; or (B) the board determines it is necessary or appropriate because of an emergency, as defined in paragraph (5) of subdivision (m) of Section 7140; or (C) the meeting is conducted on or before June 30, 2022.
(Amended by Stats. 2022, Ch. 617, Sec. 61. (SB 1202) Effective January 1, 2023.)
7511.
  (a) Whenever members are required or permitted to take any action at a meeting, a written notice of the meeting shall be given not less than 10 nor more than 90 days before the date of the meeting to each member who, on the record date for notice of the meeting, is entitled to vote thereat; provided, however, that if notice is given by mail, and the notice is not mailed by first-class, registered, or certified mail, that notice shall be given not less than 20 days before the meeting. Subject to subdivision (f), and subdivision (b) of Section 7512, the notice shall state the place, date and time of the meeting, the means of electronic transmission by and to the corporation (Sections 20 and 21), electronic video screen communication, conference 						telephone, or other means of remote communication, if any, by which members may participate in that meeting, and (1) in the case of a special meeting, the general nature of the business to be transacted, and no other business may be transacted, or (2) in the case of the regular meeting, those matters which the board, at the time the notice is given, intends to present for action by the members, but, except as provided in subdivision (b) of Section 7512, any proper matter may be presented at the meeting for the action. The notice of any meeting at which directors are to be elected shall include the names of all those who are nominees at the time the notice is given to members.
(b) (1) Notice of a members’ meeting or any report shall be given personally, by electronic transmission by a 						corporation, or by mail or other means of written communication, addressed to a member at the address of the member appearing on the books of the corporation or given by the member to the corporation for purpose of notice, or if no such address appears or is given, at the place where the principal office of the corporation is located or by publication at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the principal office is located. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the notice of a members’ meeting or any report may be sent by electronic communication or other means of remote communication if the board determines it is necessary or appropriate because of an emergency, as defined in paragraph (5) of subdivision (m) of Section 7140. An affidavit of giving of any notice or report as permitted because of an emergency or otherwise in accordance with the provisions of this part, 						executed by the secretary, assistant secretary, or any transfer agent, shall be prima facie evidence of the giving of the notice or report.
(2) If any notice or report addressed to the member at the address of the member appearing on the books of the corporation is returned to the corporation by the United States Postal Service marked to indicate that the United States Postal Service is unable to deliver the notice or report to the member at the address, all future notices or reports shall be deemed to have been duly given without further mailing if the same shall be available for the member upon written demand of the member at the principal office of the corporation for a period of one year from the date of the giving of the notice or report to all other members.
(3) (A) Notice given by electronic transmission by the corporation under this subdivision shall be valid only if it complies with Section 20. Notwithstanding the foregoing, notice shall not be given by electronic transmission by the corporation under this subdivision after either of the following:
(i) The corporation is unable to deliver two consecutive notices to the member by that means.
(ii) The inability to so deliver the notices to the member becomes known to the secretary, any assistant secretary, the transfer agent, or other person responsible for the giving of the notice.
(B) This paragraph shall not apply if notices are provided by electronic communication or other means of remote communication as permitted 						because of an emergency.
(c) Upon request in writing to the corporation addressed to the attention of the chairperson of the board, president, vice president, or secretary by any person (other than the board) entitled to call a special meeting of members, the officer forthwith shall cause notice to be given to the members entitled to vote that a meeting will be held at a time fixed by the board not less than 35 nor more than 90 days after the receipt of the request. If the corporation is a common interest development, as defined in Section 4100 of the Civil Code, the corporation shall cause notice to be given to the members entitled to vote that a meeting will be held at a time fixed by the board not less than 35 nor more than 150 days after receipt of the request. If the notice is not given within 20 days after receipt of the request, the 						persons entitled to call the meeting may give the notice or the superior court of the proper county shall summarily order the giving of the notice, after notice to the corporation giving it an opportunity to be heard. The court may issue such orders as may be appropriate, including, without limitation, orders designating the time and place of the meeting, the record date for determination of members entitled to vote, and the form of notice.
(d) When a members’ meeting is adjourned to another time or place, unless the bylaws otherwise require and except as provided in this subdivision, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof (or the means of electronic transmission by and to the corporation or electronic video screen communication, conference telephone, or other means of remote communication, if 						any, by which members may participate) are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. No meeting may be adjourned for more than 45 days. At the adjourned meeting the corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for notice or voting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each member who, on the record date for notice of the meeting, is entitled to vote at the meeting.
(e) The transactions of any meeting of members however called and noticed, and wherever held, are as valid as though had at a meeting duly held after regular call and notice, if a quorum is present either in person or by proxy, and if, either before or after the meeting, each of the persons entitled to vote, not present in person (or, if 						proxies are allowed, by proxy), provides a waiver of notice or consent to the holding of the meeting or an approval of the minutes thereof in writing. All such waivers, consents, and approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of and presence at the meeting, except when the person objects, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened and except that attendance at a meeting is not a waiver of any right to object to the consideration of matters required by this part to be included in the notice but not so included, if the objection is expressly made at the meeting. Neither the business to be transacted at nor the purpose of any regular or special meeting of members need be specified in any written waiver of 						notice, consent to the holding of the meeting or approval of the minutes thereof, unless otherwise provided in the articles or bylaws, except as provided in subdivision (f).
(f) Any approval of the members required under Section 7222, 7224, 7233, 7812, 8610, or 8719, other than unanimous approval by those entitled to vote, shall be valid only if the general nature of the proposal so approved was stated in the notice of meeting or in any written waiver of notice.
(g) A court may find that notice not given in conformity with this section is still valid, if it was given in a fair and reasonable manner.
(Amended by Stats. 2022, Ch. 617, Sec. 62. (SB 1202) Effective January 1, 2023.)
7512.
  (a) One-third of the voting power, represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of members, but, subject to subdivisions (b) and (c), a bylaw may set a different quorum. Any bylaw amendment to increase the quorum may be adopted only by approval of the members (Section 5034). If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the majority of the voting power represented at the meeting, entitled to vote, and voting on any matter shall be the act of the members unless the vote of a greater number or voting by classes is required by this part or the articles or bylaws.
(b) Where a bylaw authorizes a corporation to conduct a meeting with a quorum of less than one-third of the voting power, then the only matters that may be voted upon at any regular meeting actually attended, in person or by proxy, by less than one-third of the voting power are matters notice of the general nature of which was given, pursuant to the first sentence of subdivision (a) of Section 7511.
(c) Subject to subdivision (b), the members present at a duly called or held meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to transact business until adjournment notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough members to leave less than a quorum, if any action taken (other than adjournment) is approved by at least a majority of the members required to constitute a quorum or, if required by this division, or by the articles or the bylaws, the vote of the greater number or voting by classes.
(d) In the absence of a quorum, any meeting of members may be adjourned from time to time by the vote of a majority of the votes represented either in person or by proxy, but no other business may be transacted, except as provided in subdivision (c).
(Amended by Stats. 2000, Ch. 485, Sec. 13. Effective January 1, 2001.)
7513.
  (a) Subject to subdivision (e), and unless prohibited in the articles or bylaws, any action which may be taken at any regular or special meeting of members may be taken without a meeting if the corporation distributes a written ballot to every member entitled to vote on the matter. Unless otherwise provided by the articles or bylaws and if approved by the board of directors, that ballot and any related material may be sent by electronic transmission by the corporation (Section 20) and responses may be returned to the corporation by electronic transmission to the corporation (Section 21). That ballot shall set forth the proposed action, provide an opportunity to specify approval or disapproval of any proposal, and provide a reasonable time within which to return the ballot to the corporation.
(b) Approval by written ballot pursuant to this section shall be valid only when the number of votes cast by ballot within the time period specified equals or exceeds the quorum required to be present at a meeting authorizing the action, and the number of approvals equals or exceeds the number of votes that would be required to approve at a meeting at which the total number of votes cast was the same as the number of votes cast by ballot.
(c) Ballots shall be solicited in a manner consistent with the requirements of subdivision (b) of Section 7511 and Section 7514. All such solicitations shall indicate the number of responses needed to meet the quorum requirement and, with respect to ballots other than for the election of directors, shall state the percentage of approvals necessary to pass the measure submitted. The solicitation must specify the time by which the ballot must be received in order to be counted.
(d) Unless otherwise provided in the articles or bylaws, a written ballot may not be revoked.
(e) Directors may be elected by written ballot under this section, where authorized by the articles or bylaws, except that election by written ballot may not be authorized where the directors are elected by cumulative voting pursuant to Section 7615.
(f) When directors are to be elected by written ballot and the articles or bylaws prescribe a nomination procedure, the procedure may provide for a date for the close of nominations prior to the printing and distributing of the written ballots.
(Amended by Stats. 2004, Ch. 254, Sec. 26. Effective January 1, 2005.)
7514.
  (a) Any form of proxy or written ballot distributed to 10 or more members of a corporation with 100 or more members shall afford an opportunity on the proxy or form of written ballot to specify a choice between approval and disapproval of each matter or group of related matters intended, at the time the written ballot or proxy is distributed, to be acted upon at the meeting for which the proxy is solicited or by such written ballot, and shall provide, subject to reasonable specified conditions, that where the person solicited specifies a choice with respect to any such matter the vote shall be cast in accordance therewith.
(b)  In any election of directors, any form of proxy or written ballot in which the directors to be voted upon are named therein as candidates and which is marked by a member “withhold” or otherwise marked in a manner indicating that the authority to vote for the election of directors is withheld shall not be voted either for or against the election of a director.
(c)  Failure to comply with this section shall not invalidate any corporate action taken, but may be the basis for challenging any proxy at a meeting or written ballot and the superior court may compel compliance therewith at the suit of any member.
(Amended by Stats. 1979, Ch. 724.)
7515.
  (a) If for any reason it is impractical or unduly difficult for any corporation to call or conduct a meeting of its members, delegates or directors, or otherwise obtain their consent, in the manner prescribed by its articles or bylaws, or this part, then the superior court of the proper county, upon petition of a director, officer, delegate or member, may order that such a meeting be called or that a written ballot or other form of obtaining the vote of members, delegates or directors be authorized, in such a manner as the court finds fair and equitable under the circumstances.
(b) The court shall, in an order issued pursuant to this section, provide for a method of notice reasonably designed to give actual notice to all parties who would be entitled to notice of a meeting held pursuant to the articles, bylaws and this part, whether or not the method results in actual notice to every such person, or conforms to the notice requirements that would otherwise apply. In a proceeding under this section the court may determine who the members or directors are.
(c) The order issued pursuant to this section may dispense with any requirement relating to the holding of and voting at meetings or obtaining of votes, including any requirement as to quorums or as to the number or percentage of votes needed for approval, that would otherwise be imposed by the articles, bylaws, or this part.
(d) Wherever practical any order issued pursuant to this section shall limit the subject matter of the meetings or other forms of consent authorized to items, including amendments to the articles or bylaws, the resolution of which will or may enable the corporation to continue managing its affairs without further resort to this section; provided, however, that an order under this section may also authorize the obtaining of whatever votes and approvals are necessary for the dissolution, merger, sale of assets or reorganization of the corporation.
(e) Any meeting or other method of obtaining the vote of members, delegates or directors conducted pursuant to an order issued under this section, and which complies with all the provisions of such order, is for all purposes a valid meeting or vote, as the case may be, and shall have the same force and effect as if it complied with every requirement imposed by the articles, bylaws, and this part.
(Amended by Stats. 1986, Ch. 766, Sec. 31.)
7516.
  Any action required or permitted to be taken by the members may be taken without a meeting, if all members shall individually or collectively consent in writing to the action. The written consent or consents shall be filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the members. The action by written consent shall have the same force and effect as the unanimous vote of the members.
(Added by Stats. 1981, Ch. 587, Sec. 33.)
7517.
  (a) If the name signed on a ballot, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment corresponds to the name of a member, the corporation if acting in good faith is entitled to accept the ballot, consent, waiver or proxy appointment and give it effect as the act of the member.
(b) If the name signed on a ballot, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment does not correspond to the record name of a member, the corporation if acting in good faith is nevertheless entitled to accept the ballot, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment and give it effect as the act of the member if any of the following occur:
(1) The member is an entity and the name signed purports to be that of an officer or agent of the entity.
(2) The name signed purports to be that of an attorney-in-fact of the member and if the corporation requests, evidence acceptable to the corporation of the signatory’s authority to sign for the member has been presented with respect to the ballot, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment.
(3) Two or more persons hold the membership as cotenants or fiduciaries and the name signed purports to be the name of at least one of the coholders and the person signing appears to be acting on behalf of all the coholders.
(4) The name signed purports to be that of an administrator, executor, guardian, or conservator representing the member and, if the corporation requests, evidence of fiduciary status acceptable to the corporation has been presented with respect to the ballot, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment.
(5) The name signed purports to be that of a receiver or trustee in bankruptcy of the member, and, if the corporation requests, evidence of this status acceptable to the corporation has been presented with respect to the ballot, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment.
(c) The corporation is entitled to reject a ballot, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment if the secretary or other officer or agent authorized to tabulate votes, acting in good faith, has a reasonable basis for doubt concerning the validity of the signature or the signatory’s authority to sign for the member.
(d) The corporation and any officer or agent thereof who accepts or rejects a ballot, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment in good faith and in accordance with the standards of this section shall not be liable in damages to the member for the consequences of the acceptance or rejection.
(e) Corporate action based on the acceptance or rejection of a ballot, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment under this section is valid unless a court of competent jurisdiction determines otherwise.

(2) For purposes of this subdivision:
(A) “Common interest development” has the same meaning as that term is defined in Section 4100 of the Civil Code.

(b) No proxy shall be valid after the expiration of 11 months from the date thereof unless otherwise provided in the proxy, except that the maximum term of any proxy shall be three years from the date of execution. Every proxy continues in full force and effect until revoked by the person executing it prior to the vote pursuant thereto, except as otherwise provided in this section. Such revocation may be effected by a writing delivered to the corporation stating that the proxy is revoked or by a subsequent proxy executed by the person executing the prior proxy and presented to the meeting, or as to any meeting by attendance at such meeting and voting in person by the person executing the proxy. The dates contained on the forms of proxy presumptively determine the order of execution, regardless of the postmark dates on the envelopes in which they are mailed.
(c) A proxy is not revoked by the death or incapacity of the maker or the termination of a membership as a result thereof unless, before the vote is counted, written notice of such death or incapacity is received by the corporation.
(d) Unless otherwise provided in the articles or bylaws, the proxy of a member which states that it is irrevocable is irrevocable for the period specified therein (notwithstanding subdivisions (b) and (c)) when it is held by any of the following or a nominee of any of the following:
(1) A person who has purchased or who has agreed to purchase the membership;
(2) A creditor or creditors of the corporation or the member who extended or continued credit to the corporation or the member in consideration of the proxy if the proxy states that it was given in consideration of such extension or continuation of credit and the name of the person extending or continuing the credit; or
(3) A person who has contracted to perform services as an employee of the corporation, if the proxy is required by the contract of employment and if the proxy states that it was given in consideration of such contract of employment, the name of the employee and the period of employment contracted for.
Notwithstanding the period of irrevocability specified, the proxy becomes revocable when the agreement to purchase is terminated; the debt of the corporation or the member is paid; or the period of employment provided for in the contract of employment has terminated. In addition to the foregoing paragraphs (1) through (3), a proxy of a member may be made irrevocable (notwithstanding subdivision (c)) if it is given to secure the performance of a duty or to protect a title, either legal or equitable, until the happening of events which, by its terms, discharge the obligations secured by it.
(e) A proxy may be revoked, notwithstanding a provision making it irrevocable, by a transferee of a membership without knowledge of the existence of the provision unless the existence of the proxy and its irrevocability appears on the certificate representing the membership.
(f) Subdivision (a) notwithstanding:
(1) No amendment of the articles or bylaws repealing, restricting, creating or expanding proxy rights may be adopted without approval by the members (Section 5034); and
(2) No amendment of the articles or bylaws restricting or limiting the use of proxies may affect the validity of a previously issued irrevocable proxy during the term of its irrevocability, so long as it complied with applicable provisions, if any, of the articles or bylaws at the time of its issuance, and is otherwise valid under this section.
(g) Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, any revocable proxy covering matters requiring a vote of the members pursuant to Section 7222; Section 7224; Section 7233; paragraph (1) of subdivision (f) of this section; Section 7812; paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) of Section 7911; Section 8012; subdivision (a) of Section 8015; Section 8610; or subdivision (a) of Section 8719 is not valid as to such matters unless it sets forth the general nature of the matter to be voted on.
(Amended by Stats. 1981, Ch. 587, Sec. 37.)
7614.
  (a) In advance of any meeting of members, the board may appoint inspectors of election to act at the meeting and any adjournment thereof. If inspectors of election are not so appointed, or if any persons so appointed fail to appear or refuse to act, the chairperson of any meeting of members may, and on the request of any member or a member’s proxy shall, appoint inspectors of election (or persons to replace those who so fail or refuse) at the meeting. The number of inspectors shall be either one or three. If appointed at a meeting on the request of one or more members or proxies, the majority of members represented in person or by proxy shall determine whether one or three inspectors are to be appointed. 						In the case of any action by written ballot (Section 7513), the board may similarly appoint inspectors of election to act with powers and duties as set forth in this section.
(b) The inspectors of election shall determine the number of memberships outstanding and the voting power of each, the number represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, and the authenticity, validity and effect of proxies, receive votes, ballots or consents, hear and determine all challenges and questions in any way arising in connection with the right to vote, count and tabulate all votes or consents, determine when the polls shall close, determine the result and do such acts as may be proper to conduct the election or vote with fairness to all members.
(c) The inspectors of election 						shall perform their duties impartially, in good faith, to the best of their ability and as expeditiously as is practical. If there are three inspectors of election, the decision, act or certificate of a majority is effective in all respects as the decision, act, or certificate of all. Any report or certificate made by the inspectors of election is prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.
(Amended by Stats. 2022, Ch. 617, Sec. 63. (SB 1202) Effective January 1, 2023.)
7615.
  (a) If the articles or bylaws authorize cumulative voting, but not otherwise, every member entitled to vote at any election of directors may cumulate the member’s votes and give one candidate a number of votes equal to the number of directors to be elected multiplied by the number of votes to which the member is entitled, or distribute the member’s votes on the same principle among as many candidates as the member thinks fit. An article or bylaw provision authorizing cumulative voting may be repealed or amended only by approval of the members (Section 5034), except that the governing article or bylaw provision may require the vote of a greater proportion of the members, or of the members of any class, for its repeal.
(b) No member shall be entitled to cumulate votes for a candidate or candidates unless the candidate’s name or candidates’ names have been placed in nomination prior to the voting and the member has given notice at the meeting prior to the voting of the member’s intention to cumulate votes. If any one member has given this notice, all members may cumulate their votes for candidates in nomination.
(c) In any election of directors by cumulative voting, the candidates receiving the highest number of votes are elected, subject to any lawful provision specifying election by classes.
(d) In any election of directors not governed by subdivision (c), unless otherwise provided in the articles or bylaws, the candidates receiving the highest number of votes are elected.
(e) Elections for directors need not be by ballot unless a member demands election by ballot at the meeting and before the voting begins or unless the bylaws so require.
(Amended by Stats. 1984, Ch. 812, Sec. 10.)
7616.
  (a) Upon the filing of an action therefor by any director or member or by any person who had the right to vote in the election at issue, the superior court of the proper county shall determine the validity of any election or appointment of any director of any corporation.
(b) In the case of a corporation holding assets in charitable trust, any person bringing an action under this section shall give notice of the action to the Attorney General, who may intervene.
(c) Upon the filing of the complaint, and before any further proceedings are had, the court shall enter an order fixing a date for the hearing, which shall be within five days unless for good cause shown a later date is fixed, and requiring notice of the date for the hearing and a copy of the complaint to be served upon the corporation and upon the person whose purported election or appointment is questioned and upon any person (other than the plaintiff) whom the plaintiff alleges to have been elected or appointed, in the manner in which a summons is required to be served, or, if the court so directs, by registered mail; and the court may make such further requirements as to notice as appear to be proper under the circumstances.
(d) The court, consistent with the provisions of this part and in conformity with the articles and bylaws to the extent feasible, may determine the person entitled to the office of director or may order a new election to be held or appointment to be made, may determine the validity, effectiveness and construction of voting agreements and voting trusts, the validity of the issuance of memberships and the right of persons to vote and may direct such other relief as may be just and proper.

CHAPTER 7. Members’ Derivative Actions [7710- 7710.]  ( Chapter 7 added by Stats. 1978, Ch. 567. )

7710.
  (a) Subdivisions (c) through (f) notwithstanding, no motion to require a bond shall be granted in an action brought by 100 members or the authorized number (Section 5036), whichever is less.
(b) No action may be instituted or maintained in the right of any corporation by any member of such corporation unless both of the following conditions exist:
(1) The plaintiff alleges in the complaint that plaintiff was a member at the time of the transaction or any part thereof of which plaintiff complains, or that plaintiff’s membership thereafter devolved upon plaintiff by operation of law from a holder who was a holder at the time of transaction or any part thereof complained of; and
(2) The plaintiff alleges in the complaint with particularity plaintiff’s efforts to secure from the board such action as plaintiff desires, or the reasons for not making such effort, and alleges further that plaintiff has either informed the corporation or the board in writing of the ultimate facts of each cause of action against each defendant or delivered to the corporation or the board a true copy of the complaint which plaintiff proposes to file.
(c) Subject to subdivision (a), in any action referred to in subdivision (b), at any time within 30 days after service of summons upon the corporation or upon any defendant who is an officer or director of the corporation, or held such office at the time of the acts complained of, the corporation or such defendant may move the court for an order, upon notice and hearing, requiring the plaintiff to furnish a bond as hereinafter provided. The motion shall be based upon one or both of the following grounds:
(1) That there is no reasonable possibility that the prosecution of the cause of action alleged in the complaint against the moving party will benefit the corporation or its members economically or otherwise.
(2) That the moving party, if other than the corporation, did not participate in the transaction complained of in any capacity.
The court on application of the corporation or any defendant may, for good cause shown, extend the 30-day period for an additional period or periods not exceeding 60 days.
(d) At the hearing upon any motion pursuant to subdivision (c), the court shall consider such evidence, written or oral, by witnesses or affidavit, as may be material (1) to the ground or grounds upon which the motion is based, or (2) to a determination of the probable reasonable expenses, including attorneys’ fees, of the corporation and the moving party which will be incurred in the defense of the action. If the court determines, after hearing the evidence adduced by the parties, that the moving party has established a probability in support of any of the grounds upon which the motion is based, the court shall fix the amount of the bond, not to exceed fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), to be furnished by the plaintiff for reasonable expenses, including attorneys’ fees, which may be incurred by the moving party and the corporation in connection with the action, including expenses for which the corporation may become liable pursuant to Section 7237. A ruling by the court on the motion shall not be a determination of any issue in the action or of the merits thereof. If the court, upon any such motion, makes a determination that a bond shall be furnished by the plaintiff as to any one or more defendants, the action shall be dismissed as to such defendant or defendants, unless the bond required by the court has been furnished within such reasonable time as may be fixed by the court.
(e) If the plaintiff shall, either before or after a motion is made pursuant to subdivision (c), or any order or determination pursuant to such motion, furnish a bond or bonds in the aggregate amount of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) to secure the reasonable expenses of the parties entitled to make the motion, the plaintiff has complied with the requirements of this section and with any order for a bond theretofore made, and any such motion then pending shall be dismissed and no further or additional bond shall be required.
(f) If a motion is filed pursuant to subdivision (c), no pleadings need be filed by the corporation or any other defendant and the prosecution of the action shall be stayed until 10 days after the motion has been disposed of.

7810.
  (a) By complying with the provisions of this chapter, a corporation may amend its articles from time to time, in any and as many respects as may be desired, so long as its articles as amended contain only such provisions as it would be lawful to insert in original articles filed at the time of the filing of the amendment or as authorized by Section 7813.5 and, if a change in the rights of members or an exchange, reclassification or cancellation of memberships is to be made, such provisions as may be necessary to effect such change, exchange, reclassification or cancellation. It is the intent of the Legislature in adopting this section to exercise to the fullest extent the reserve power of the state over 						corporations and to authorize any amendment of the articles covered by the preceding sentence regardless of whether any provision contained in the amendment was permissible at the time of the original incorporation of the corporation.
(b) A corporation shall not amend its articles to add any statement or to alter any statement which may appear in the original articles of the initial street address and initial mailing address of the corporation, the names and addresses of the first directors, or the name and address of the initial agent, except to correct an error in the statement or to delete the information after the corporation has filed a statement under Section 8210.

(b) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), the following amendments may be adopted by approval of the board alone:
(1) An amendment extending the corporate existence or making the corporate existence perpetual, if the corporation was organized prior to August 						14, 1929.
(2) An amendment deleting the initial street address and initial mailing address of the corporation, the names and addresses of the first directors, or the name and address of the initial agent.
(3) Any amendment, at a time the corporation has no members; provided, however, that if the articles require approval by any person for an amendment, an amendment may not be adopted without such approval.
(4) An amendment adopted pursuant to Section 9913.
(c) Whenever the articles require for corporate action the approval of a particular class of members or of a larger proportion of, or all of, the votes of any class, or of a larger proportion of, or all of, 						the directors, than is otherwise required by this part, the provision in the articles requiring such greater vote shall not be altered, amended or repealed except by such class or such greater vote, unless otherwise provided in the articles.
(Amended by Stats. 2012, Ch. 494, Sec. 20. (SB 1532) Effective January 1, 2013.)
7813.
  An amendment must also be approved by the members (Section 5034) of a class, whether or not such class is entitled to vote thereon by the provisions of the articles or bylaws, if the amendment would:
(a) Materially and adversely affect the rights, privileges, preferences, restrictions or conditions of that class as to voting, dissolution, redemption or transfer in a manner different than such action affects another class;
(b) Materially and adversely affect such class as to voting, dissolution, redemption or transfer by changing the rights, privileges, preferences, restrictions or conditions of another class;
(c) Increase or decrease the number of memberships authorized for such class;
(d) Increase the number of memberships authorized for another class;

  (a) A mutual benefit corporation may amend its articles to change its status to that of a public benefit corporation, a religious corporation, a business corporation, a social purpose corporation, or a cooperative corporation by complying with this section and the other sections of this chapter.
(b) Except as authorized by Section 7811 or unless the corporation has no members, an amendment to change its status to a public benefit corporation or religious corporation shall: (1) be approved by the members (Section 5034), and the fairness of the amendment to the members shall be approved by the Commissioner of Financial Protection and Innovation pursuant to Section 25142; (2) be 						approved by the members (Section 5034) in an election conducted by written ballot pursuant to Section 7513 in which no negative votes are cast; or (3) be approved by 100 percent of the voting power.

(d) At 						the time of filing a certificate of amendment to change status to a public benefit corporation, the Secretary of State shall 						make available the filed certificate to the Attorney General.
(e) In the case of a change of status to a business corporation, social purpose corporation, or a cooperative corporation, if the Franchise Tax Board has issued a determination exempting the corporation from tax as provided in Section 23701 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, the corporation shall be subject to Section 23221 of the Revenue and Taxation Code upon filing the certificate of amendment.
(Amended by Stats. 2022, Ch. 617, Sec. 64. (SB 1202) Effective January 1, 2023.)
7814.

(1) The wording of the amendment or amended articles in accordance with Section 7816;
(2) That the amendment has been approved by the board;
(3) If the amendment is one for which the approval of the members (Section 5034) or the approval of 100 percent of the voting power is required, that the amendment was approved by the required vote of members; and
(4) If the amendment is one which may be adopted with approval by the board alone, a statement of the facts entitling the board alone to adopt the amendment.
(5) If the amendment is one for which the approval of a person or persons other than the incorporators, directors or members is required, that the approval of such person or persons has been obtained.
(b) In the event of an amendment of the articles pursuant to a merger, the filing of the officers’ certificate and agreement pursuant to Section 8014 shall be in lieu of any filing required under this chapter.
(Amended by Stats. 1979, Ch. 724.)
7815.
  In the case of amendments adopted by the incorporators under Section 7811, the corporation shall file a certificate of amendment signed and verified by a majority of the incorporators which shall state that the signers thereof constitute at least a majority of the incorporators, that directors were not named in the original articles and have not been elected, that the corporation has no members and that they adopt the amendment or amendments therein set forth.
(Amended by Stats. 1979, Ch. 724.)
7816.
  The certificate of amendment shall establish the wording of the amendment or amended articles by one or more of the following means:
(a) By stating that the articles shall be amended to read as therein set forth in full.
(b) By stating that any provision of the articles, which shall be identified by the numerical or other designation given it in the articles or by stating the wording thereof, shall be stricken from the articles or shall be amended to read as set forth in the certificate.
(c) By stating that the provisions set forth therein shall be added to the articles.
If the purpose of the amendment is to reclassify, cancel, exchange, or otherwise change outstanding memberships the amended articles shall state the effect thereof on outstanding memberships.
(Added by Stats. 1978, Ch. 567.)
7817.
  Upon the filing of the certificate of amendment, the articles shall be amended in accordance with the certificate and any change, reclassification or cancellation of memberships shall be effected, and a copy of the certificate, certified by the Secretary of State, is prima facie evidence of the performance of the conditions necessary to the adoption of the amendment.
(Added by Stats. 1978, Ch. 567.)
7818.
  A corporation formed for a limited period may at any time subsequent to the expiration of the term of its corporate existence, extend the term of its existence by an amendment to its articles removing any provision limiting the term of its existence and providing for perpetual existence. If the filing of the certificate of amendment providing for perpetual existence would be prohibited if it were original articles by the provisions of Section 7122, the Secretary of State shall not file such certificate unless, by the same or a concurrently filed certificate of amendment, the articles of such corporation are amended to adopt a new available name. For the purpose of the adoption of any such amendment, persons who have been functioning as directors of such corporation shall be considered to have been validly elected even though their election may have occurred after the expiration of the original term of the corporate existence.
(Added by Stats. 1978, Ch. 567.)
7819.
  (a) A corporation may restate in a single certificate the entire text of its articles as amended by filing an officers’ certificate or, in circumstances where incorporators or the board may amend a corporation’s articles pursuant to Sections 7811 and 7815, a certificate signed and verified by a majority of the incorporators or the board, as applicable, entitled “Restated Articles of Incorporation of (insert name of corporation)” which shall set forth the articles as amended to the date of filing of the certificate, except that the signatures and acknowledgments of the articles by the incorporators and any statements regarding the effect of any prior amendment upon memberships and any provisions of agreements of 						merger (other than amendments to the articles of the surviving corporation), and the initial street address and initial mailing address of the corporation, and the names and addresses of the first directors and of the initial agent for service of process shall be omitted (except that the initial street address and initial mailing address of the corporation and the names and addresses of the initial agent for service of process and, if previously set forth in the articles, the initial directors, shall not be omitted prior to the time that the corporation has filed a statement under Section 8210). Such omissions are not alterations or amendments of the articles. The certificate may also itself alter or amend the articles in any respect, in which case the certificate must comply with Section 7814 or 7815, as the case may be, and Section 7816.
(b) If the certificate does not itself alter or amend the articles in any respect, it shall be approved by the board or, prior to the issuance of any memberships and the naming and election of directors, by a majority of the incorporators, and shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter relating to an amendment of the articles not requiring approval of the members (Section 5034). If the certificate does itself alter or amend the articles, it shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter relating to the amendment or amendments so made.
(c) Restated articles of incorporation filed pursuant to this section shall supersede for all purposes the original articles and all amendments filed prior thereto.

(b) The Attorney General may, at the corporation’s request, and pursuant to such regulations as the Attorney General may issue, give rulings as to whether the Attorney General will or may oppose a proposed action, or article amendment, as inconsistent with or proscribed by the requirements of a charitable trust.

CHAPTER 9. Sales of Assets [7910 - 7914]  ( Chapter 9 added by Stats. 1978, Ch. 567. )

7910.
  Any mortgage, deed of trust, pledge or other hypothecation of all or any part of the corporation’s property, real or personal, for the purpose of securing the payment or performance of any contract or obligation may be approved by the board. Unless the articles or bylaws otherwise provide, no approval of the members (Section 5034) shall be necessary for such action.
(Added by Stats. 1978, Ch. 567.)
7911.
  (a) Subject to the provisions of Section 7142, a corporation may sell, lease, convey, exchange, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets when the principal terms are:
(1) Approved by the board; and
(2) Unless the transaction is in the usual and regular course of its activities, approved by the members (Section 5034), either before or after approval by the board and before or after the transaction.
(b) Notwithstanding approval by the members (Section 5034), the board may abandon the proposed transaction without further action by the members, subject to the contractual rights, if any, of third parties.
(c) Subject to the provisions of Section 7142, such sale, lease, conveyance, exchange, transfer or other disposition may be made upon such terms and conditions and for such consideration as the board may deem in the best interests of the corporation. The consideration may be money, property, or securities of any domestic corporation, foreign corporation, or foreign business corporation or any of them.
(Amended by Stats. 1981, Ch. 587, Sec. 39.)
7912.
  Any deed or instrument conveying or otherwise transferring any assets of a corporation may have annexed to it the certificate of the secretary or an assistant secretary of the corporation, setting forth that the transaction has been validly approved by the board and (a) stating that the property described in such deed or instrument is less than substantially all of the assets of the corporation or that the transfer is in the usual and regular course of the business of the corporation, if such be the case, or (b) if such property constitutes all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation and the transfer is not in the usual and regular course of the business of the corporation, stating the fact of approval thereof by the members (Section 5034) or all the members pursuant to this chapter. Such certificate is prima facie evidence of the existence of the facts authorizing such conveyance or other transfer of the assets and conclusive evidence in favor of any purchaser or encumbrancer for value who, without notice of any trust restriction applicable to the property or any failure to comply therewith, in good faith parted with value.
(Added by Stats. 1978, Ch. 567.)
7913.
  A corporation holding assets in charitable trust must give written notice to the Attorney General 20 days before it sells, leases, conveys, exchanges, transfers or otherwise disposes of any or all of the assets held in trust unless the Attorney General has given the corporation a written waiver of this section as to the proposed transaction.
(Added by Stats. 1978, Ch. 567.)

  (a) Any provision of the articles or bylaws notwithstanding, every corporation shall furnish annually to its members and directors a statement of any transaction or indemnification of a kind described in subdivision (d) or (e), if any such transaction or indemnification took place. If the corporation issues an annual report to all members, this subdivision shall be satisfied by including the required information in the annual report. A corporation which does not issue an annual report to all members, pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 8321, shall satisfy this section by mailing or delivering to its members the required statement within 120 days after the close of the corporation’s fiscal year. Unless otherwise provided by the articles or bylaws and if approved by the board of directors, that statement may be sent by electronic transmission by the corporation (Section 20).

(1) Any covered transaction (excluding compensation of officers and directors) during the previous fiscal year involving more than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), or which was one of a number of covered transactions in which the same interested person had a direct or indirect material financial interest, and which transactions in the aggregate involved more than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000).
(2) The names of the interested persons involved in such transactions, stating such person’s relationship to the corporation, the nature of such person’s interest in the transaction and, where practicable, the amount of such interest; provided, that in the case of a transaction with a partnership of which such person is a partner, only the interest of the partnership need be stated.

(b) A 				 corporation shall furnish any member who so requests a copy of any report filed by the corporation pursuant to Article 7 (commencing with Section 12580) of Chapter 6 of Part 2 of Division 3 of the Government Code.

ARTICLE 3. Rights of Inspection [8330 - 8338]  ( Article 3 added by Stats. 1978, Ch. 567. )

8330.
  (a) Subject to Sections 8331 and 8332, and unless the corporation provides a reasonable alternative pursuant to subdivision (c), a member may do either or both of the following as permitted by subdivision (b):
(1) Inspect and copy the record of all the members’ names, addresses and voting rights, at reasonable times, upon five business days’ prior written demand upon the corporation which demand shall state the purpose for which the inspection rights are requested; or
(2) Obtain from the secretary of the corporation, upon written demand and tender of a reasonable charge, a list of the names, addresses and voting rights of those members entitled to vote for the election of directors, as of the most recent record date for which it has been compiled or as of a date specified by the member subsequent to the date of demand. The demand shall state the purpose for which the list is requested. The membership list shall be made available on or before the later of ten business days after the demand is received or after the date specified therein as the date as of which the list is to be compiled.
(b) The rights set forth in subdivision (a) may be exercised by:
(1) Any member, for a purpose reasonably related to such person’s interest as a member. Where the corporation reasonably believes that the information will be used for another purpose, or where it provides a reasonable alternative pursuant to subdivision (c), it may deny the member access to the list. In any subsequent action brought by the member under Section 8336, the court shall enforce the rights set forth in subdivision (a) unless the corporation proves that the member will allow use of the information for purposes unrelated to the person’s interest as a member or that the alternative method offered reasonably achieves the proper purpose set forth in the demand.
(2) The authorized number of members for a purpose reasonably related to the members’ interest as members.
(c) The corporation may, within ten business days after receiving a demand under subdivision (a), deliver to the person or persons making the demand a written offer of an alternative method of achieving the purpose identified in said demand without providing access to or a copy of the membership list. An alternative method which reasonably and in a timely manner accomplishes the proper purpose set forth in a demand made under subdivision (a) shall be deemed a reasonable alternative, unless within a reasonable time after acceptance of the offer the corporation fails to do those things which it offered to do. Any rejection of the offer shall be in writing and shall indicate the reasons the alternative proposed by the corporation does not meet the proper purpose of the demand made pursuant to subdivision (a).
(Added by Stats. 1978, Ch. 567.)
8331.
  (a) Where the corporation, in good faith, and with a substantial basis, believes that the membership list, demanded under Section 8330 by the authorized number (Section 5036), will be used for a purpose not reasonably related to the interests as members of the person or persons making the demand (hereinafter called the requesting parties) as members or provides a reasonable alternative pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 8330, it may petition the superior court of the proper county for an order setting aside the demand.
(b) Except as provided in subdivision (c), a petition for an order to show cause why a protective order pursuant to subdivision (d) should not issue shall be filed within 10 business days after the demand by the authorized number under Section 8330 or receipt of a written rejection by the authorized number of an offer made pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 8330, whichever is later. The petition shall be accompanied by an application for a hearing on the petition. Upon the filing of the petition, the court shall issue a protective order staying production of the list demanded until the hearing on the order to show cause. The court shall set the hearing on the order to show cause not more than 20 days from the date of the filing of the petition. The order to show cause shall be granted unless the court finds that there is no reasonable probability that the corporation will make the showing required under subdivision (f).
(c) A corporation may file a petition under this section more than 10 business days after the demand or rejection under Section 8330, but only upon a showing the delay was caused by excusable neglect. In no event, however, may any petition under this section be considered if filed more than 30 days after the requesting parties’ demand or rejection, whichever is later.
(d) Upon the return day of the order to show cause, the court may issue a protective order staying production of the list demanded until final adjudication of the petition filed pursuant to this section. No protective order shall issue under this subdivision unless the court finds that the rights of the requesting parties can reasonably be preserved and that the corporation is likely to make the showing required by subdivision (f) or the court is likely to issue a protective order pursuant to subdivision (g).
(e) If the corporation fails to file a petition within the time allowed by subdivision (b) or (c), whichever is applicable, or fails to obtain a protective order under subdivision (d), then the corporation shall comply with the demand, and no further action may be brought by the corporation under this section.
(f) The court shall issue the final order setting aside the demand only if the corporation proves:
(1) That there is a reasonable probability that the requesting parties will permit use of the membership list for a purpose unrelated to their interests as members; or
(2) That the method offered by the corporation is a reasonable alternative in that it reasonably achieves the proper purpose set forth in the requesting parties’ demand and that the corporation intends and is able to effectuate the reasonable alternative.
(g) In the final order, the court may, in its discretion, order an alternate mechanism for achieving the proper purposes of the requesting parties, or impose just and proper conditions upon the use of the membership list which reasonably assures compliance with Section 8330 and Section 8338.
(h) The court shall award reasonable costs and expenses including reasonable attorneys’ fees, to requesting parties who successfully oppose any petition or application filed pursuant to this section.
(i) Where the corporation has neither, within the time allowed, complied with a demand by the authorized number (Section 5036) under Section 8330, nor obtained a protective order staying production of the list, or a final order setting aside the demand, which is then in effect, the requesting parties may petition the superior court of the proper county for a writ of mandamus pursuant to Section 1085 of the Code of Civil Procedure compelling the corporation to comply with the demand. At the hearing, the court shall hear the parties summarily, by affidavit or otherwise, and shall issue a peremptory writ of mandamus unless it appears that the demand was not made by an authorized number (Section 5036), that the demand has been complied with, that the corporation, pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 8330, made an offer which was not rejected in writing within a reasonable time, or that a protective or final order properly issued under subdivision (d), (f) or (g) is then in effect. No inquiry may be made in such proceeding into the use for which the authorized number seek the list. The court shall award reasonable costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, to persons granted an order under this subdivision.
(j) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the right of the corporation to obtain damages for any misuse of a membership list obtained under Section 8330, or otherwise, or to obtain injunctive relief necessary to restrain misuse of a member list. A corporation shall be entitled to recover reasonable costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, incurred in successfully bringing any such action.
(Amended by Stats. 1979, Ch. 724.)
8332.
  (a) Upon petition of the corporation or any member, the superior court of the proper county may limit or restrict the rights set forth in Section 8330 where, and only where, such limitation or restriction is necessary to protect the rights of any member under the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution of the State of California. An order issued pursuant to this subdivision shall provide, insofar as possible, for alternative mechanisms by which the persons seeking to exercise rights under Section 8330 may communicate with members for purposes reasonably related to their interests as members.
(b) Upon the filing of a petition under subdivision (a), the court may, if requested by the person making the petition, issue a temporary order suspending the running of any time limit specified in Section 8330 for compliance with that section. Such an order may be extended, after notice and hearing, until final adjudication of the petition, wherever it appears that the petitioner may prevail on the merits, and it is otherwise equitable to do so.
(Added by Stats. 1978, Ch. 567.)
8333.
  The accounting books and records and minutes of proceedings of the members and the board and committees of the board shall be open to inspection upon the written demand on the corporation of any member at any reasonable time, for a purpose reasonably related to such person’s interests as a member.
(Added by Stats. 1978, Ch. 567.)
8334.
  Every director shall have the absolute right at any reasonable time to inspect and copy all books, records and documents of every kind and to inspect the physical properties of the corporation of which such person is a director.
(Added by Stats. 1978, Ch. 567.)
8335.
  Where the proper purpose of the person or persons making a demand pursuant to Section 8330 is frustrated by (1) any delay by the corporation in complying with a demand under Section 8330 beyond the time limits specified therein, or (2) any delay caused by the filing of a petition under Section 8331 or Section 8332, or (3) any delay caused by the alternative proposed under subdivision (c) of Section 8330, the person or persons properly making the demand shall have, in the discretion of the court, a right to obtain from the superior court an order postponing any members’ meeting previously noticed for a period equal to the period of such delay. The members may obtain such an order in a proceeding brought pursuant to Section 8331 upon the filing of a verified complaint in the proper county and after a hearing, notice of which shall be given to such persons and in such manner as the court may direct. Such right shall be in addition to any other legal or equitable remedies to which the member may be entitled.
(Amended by Stats. 1979, Ch. 724.)
8336.
  (a) Upon refusal of a lawful demand for inspection under this chapter, or a lawful demand pursuant to Section 8330 or Section 8333, the superior court of the proper county, or the county where the books or records in question are kept, may enforce the demand or right of inspection with just and proper conditions or may, for good cause shown, appoint one or more competent inspectors or independent accountants to audit the financial statements kept in this state and investigate the property, funds and affairs of any corporation and of any subsidiary corporation thereof, domestic or foreign, keeping records in this state and to report thereon in such manner as the court may direct.
(b) All officers and agents of the corporation shall produce to the inspectors or accountants so appointed all books and documents in their custody or power, under penalty of punishment for contempt of court.
(c) All expenses of the investigation or audit shall be defrayed by the applicant unless the court orders them to be paid or shared by the corporation.
(Amended by Stats. 1979, Ch. 724.)
8337.
  In any action or proceeding under this article, and except as required by Section 8331, if the court finds the failure of the corporation to comply with a proper demand thereunder was without justification, the court may award the member reasonable costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, in connection with such action or proceeding.
(Added by Stats. 1978, Ch. 567.)
8338.
  (a) A membership list is a corporate asset. Without consent of the board a membership list or any part thereof may not be obtained or used by any person for any purpose not reasonably related to a member’s interest as a member. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, without the consent of the board a membership list or any part thereof may not be:
(1) Used to solicit money or property unless such money or property will be used solely to solicit the vote of the members in an election to be held by their corporation.
(2) Used for any purpose which the user does not reasonably and in good faith believe will benefit the corporation.
(3) Used for any commercial purpose or purpose in competition with the corporation.
(4) Sold to or purchased by any person.
(b) Any person who violates the provisions of subdivision (a) shall be liable for any damage such violation causes the corporation and shall account for and pay to the corporation any profit derived as a result of said violation. In addition, a court in its discretion may award exemplary damages for a fraudulent or malicious violation of subdivision (a).
(c) Nothing in this article shall be construed to limit the right of a corporation to obtain injunctive relief necessary to restrain misuse of a membership list or any part thereof.
(d) In any action or proceeding under this section, a court may award the corporation reasonable costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, in connection with such action or proceeding.
(e) As used in this section, the term “membership list” means the record of the members’ names and addresses.

(b) The grounds for involuntary dissolution are that:
(1) The corporation has abandoned its activity for more than one year.
(2) The corporation has an even number of directors who are equally divided and cannot agree as to the management of its affairs, so that its activities can no longer be conducted to advantage or so that there is danger that its property will be impaired or lost or its activities impaired and the members are so divided into factions that they cannot elect a board consisting of an uneven number.
(3) There is internal dissension and two or more factions of members in the corporation are so deadlocked that its activities can no longer be conducted with advantage.
(4) When during any four-year period or when all voting power has been exercised at two consecutive meetings or in two written ballots for the election of directors, whichever period is shorter, the members have failed to elect successors to directors whose terms have expired or would have expired upon election of their successors.

8511.
  (a) The Attorney General may bring an action against any corporation or purported corporation in the name of the people of this state, upon the Attorney General’s own information or upon complaint of a private party, to procure a judgment dissolving the corporation and annulling, vacating or forfeiting its corporate existence upon any of the following grounds:
(1) The corporation has seriously offended against any provision of the statutes regulating corporations.

(c) In any such action the court may order dissolution or such other or partial relief as it deems just and expedient. The court also may appoint a receiver for winding up the affairs of the corporation or may order that the corporation be wound up by its board subject to the supervision of the court.
(d) Service of process on the corporation may be made pursuant to Chapter 17 (commencing with Section 1700) of Division 1 or by written notice to the president or secretary of the corporation at the address indicated in the corporation’s last tax return filed pursuant to the Bank and Corporation Tax Law.

The provisions of subdivision (d) of Section 7225 apply to any such provisional director so appointed.
(Added by Stats. 1978, Ch. 567.)
8513.
  If, at the time of the filing of a complaint for involuntary dissolution or at any time thereafter, the court has reasonable grounds to believe that unless a receiver of the corporation is appointed the interests of the corporation or its members will suffer pending the hearing and determination of the complaint, upon the application of the plaintiff, and after a hearing upon such notice to the corporation as the court may direct and upon the giving of security pursuant to Sections 566 and 567 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the court may appoint a receiver to take over and manage the affairs of the corporation and to preserve its property pending the hearing and determination of the complaint for dissolution.

(Added by Stats. 1978, Ch. 567.)
8515.
  (a) Involuntary proceedings for winding up a corporation commence when the order for winding up is entered under Section 8514.
(b) When an involuntary proceeding for winding up has commenced, the board shall conduct the winding up of the affairs of the corporation, subject to the supervision of the court, unless other persons are appointed by the court, on good cause shown, to conduct the winding up.

(c) When an involuntary proceeding for winding up has commenced, the corporation shall cease to conduct its activities except to the extent necessary for the beneficial winding up thereof and except during such period as the board may deem necessary to preserve the corporation’s goodwill or going-concern value, pending a sale or other disposition of its assets, or both, in whole or in part. The directors shall cause written notice of the commencement of the proceeding for involuntary winding up to be given by mail to all members and to all known creditors and claimants whose addresses appear on the records of the corporation, unless the order for winding up has been stayed by appeal therefrom or otherwise or the proceeding or the execution of the order has been enjoined.
(Added by Stats. 1978, Ch. 567.)
8516.
  When an involuntary proceeding for winding up has been commenced, the jurisdiction of the court includes:
(a) The requirement of the proof of all claims and demands against the corporation, whether due or not yet due, contingent, unliquidated or sounding only in damages, and the barring from participation of creditors and claimants failing to make and present claims and proof as required by any order.
(b) The determination or compromise of all claims of every nature against the corporation or any of its property, and the determination of the amount of money or assets required to be retained to pay or provide for the payment of claims.
(c) The determination of the rights of members and of all classes of members in and to the assets of the corporation.
(d) The presentation and filing of intermediate and final accounts of the directors or other persons appointed to conduct the winding up and hearing thereon, the allowance, disallowance or settlement thereof and the discharge of the directors or such other persons from their duties and liabilities.

(f) The filling of any vacancies on the board which the directors or the members are unable to fill.
(g) The removal of any director if it appears that the director has been guilty of dishonesty, misconduct, neglect or breach of trust in conducting the winding up or if the director is unable to act. The court may order an election to fill the vacancy so caused, and may enjoin, for such time as it considers proper, the reelection of the director so removed; or the court, in lieu of ordering an election, may appoint a director to fill the vacancy caused by such removal. Any director so appointed by the court shall serve until the next regular meeting of members or until a successor is elected or appointed.
(h) The staying of the prosecution of any suit, proceeding or action against the corporation and requiring the parties to present and prove their claims in the manner required of other creditors.
(i) The determination of whether adequate provision has been made for payment or satisfaction of all debts and liabilities not actually paid.

  (a) All creditors and claimants may be barred from participation in any distribution of the general assets if they fail to make and present claims and proofs within such time as the court may direct, which shall not be less than four nor more than six months after the first publication of notice to creditors unless it appears by affidavit that there are no claims, in which case the time limit may be three months. If it is shown that a claimant did not receive notice because of absence from the state or other cause, the court may allow a claim to be filed or presented at any time before distribution is completed.
(b) Such notice to creditors shall be published not less than once a week for three consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation published in the county in which the proceeding is pending or, if there is no such newspaper published in that county, in such newspaper as may be designated by the court, directing creditors and claimants to make and present claims and proofs to the person, at the place and within the time specified in the notice.

(b) Summons or other process against the corporation may be served by delivering a copy thereof to an officer, director, or person having charge of its assets or, if none of these persons can be found, to any agent upon whom process might be served at the time of dissolution. If none of those 				 persons can be found with due diligence and it is so shown by affidavit to the satisfaction of the court, then the court may make an order that summons or other process be served upon the dissolved corporation by personally delivering a copy thereof, together with a copy of the order, to the Secretary of State or an assistant or deputy secretary of state, with an additional copy of the summons or other process and order being delivered to the Attorney General in the case of a corporation that at the commencement of the dissolution proceedings held assets in charitable trust.

Any judgment rendered in that action shall bind each of its members or other persons having any equity or other interest in the corporation, to the extent of their interest therein, and that action shall have the same force and effect as an action brought under the provisions of Sections 410.50 and 410.60 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Service of summons or other process in that action may be made as provided in Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 413.10) of Title 5 of Part 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure or as provided in subdivision (b).
(d) Upon receipt of that process and the fee therefor, the Secretary of State forthwith shall give notice to the corporation as provided in Section 1702.

9210.
  Subject to the provisions of this part and any provision in the articles or bylaws:
(a) Each corporation shall have a board of directors. The activities and affairs of a corporation shall be conducted and all corporate powers shall be exercised by or under the direction of the board.
(b) The board may delegate the management of the activities of the corporation to any person or persons provided that the activities and affairs of the corporation shall be managed and all corporate powers shall be exercised under the ultimate direction of the board.
(Amended by Stats. 1996, Ch. 589, Sec. 40. Effective January 1, 1997.)
9211.
  (a) Unless otherwise provided in the articles or in the bylaws, all of the following apply:
(1) Meetings of the board may be called by the chair of the board or the president or any vice president or the secretary or any two directors.
(2) Regular meetings of the board may be held without notice if the time and place of the meetings are fixed by the bylaws or the board. Special meetings of the board shall be held upon four days’ notice by first-class mail or 48 hours’ notice delivered personally or by telephone, including a voice messaging system or by electronic transmission by a corporation (Section 20). The articles or bylaws may not dispense with notice of a special meeting. A notice, or waiver of 				 notice, need not specify the purpose of any regular or special meeting of the board.
(3) Notice of a meeting need not be given to a director who provided a waiver of notice or consent to holding the meeting or an approval of the minutes thereof in writing, whether before or after the meeting, or who attends the meeting without protesting, prior thereto or at its commencement, the lack of notice to that director. These waivers, consents and approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meetings.
(4) A majority of the directors present, whether or not a quorum is present, may adjourn any meeting to another time and place.
(5) Meetings of the board may be held at a place within or without the state that has been designated in the notice of the meeting or, if not stated in the 				 notice or there is no notice, designated in the bylaws or by resolution of the board.
(6) Directors may participate in a meeting through use of conference telephone, electronic video screen communication, or electronic transmission by and to the corporation. Participation in a meeting through use of conference telephone or electronic video screen communication pursuant to this subdivision constitutes presence in person at that meeting as long as all directors participating in the meeting are able to hear one another. Participation in a meeting through use of electronic transmission by and to the corporation, other than conference telephone and electronic video screen communication pursuant to this subdivision constitutes presence in person at that meeting, if both of the following apply:
(A) Each director participating in the meeting can communicate with all of the other directors 				 concurrently.
(B) Each director is provided the means of participating in all matters before the board, including, without limitation, the capacity to propose, or to interpose an objection to, a specific action to be taken by the corporation.
(7) A majority of the number of directors authorized in or pursuant to the articles or bylaws constitutes a quorum of the board for the transaction of business.
The articles or bylaws may require the presence of one or more specified directors in order to constitute a quorum of the board to transact business, as long as the death or nonexistence of a specified director or the death or nonexistence of the person or persons otherwise authorized to appoint or designate that director does not prevent the corporation from transacting business in the normal course of events.
(8) An act or decision done or made by a majority of the directors present at a meeting duly held at which a quorum is present is the act of the board. The articles or bylaws may not provide that a lesser vote than a majority of the directors present at a meeting is the act of the board. A meeting at which a quorum is initially present may continue to transact business notwithstanding the withdrawal of directors if any action taken is approved by at least a majority of the required quorum for that meeting, or a greater number required by this division, the articles or the bylaws.
(b) An action required or permitted to be taken by the board may be taken without a meeting if all directors shall individually or collectively consent in writing to that action and if, subject to subdivision (a) of Section 9224, the number of directors then in office constitutes a quorum. The written 				 consent or consents shall be filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the board. The action by written consent shall have the same force and effect as a unanimous vote of the directors. For purposes of this subdivision only, “all directors” does not include an “interested director” as defined in subdivision (a) of Section 9243 or a “common director” as described in subdivision (a) of Section 9244 who abstains in writing from providing consent, where (1) the facts described in paragraph (2) or (3) of subdivision (d) of Section 9243 are established or the provisions of paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 9244 are satisfied, as appropriate, at or prior to execution of the written consent or consents; (2) the establishment of those facts or satisfaction of those provisions, as applicable, is included in the written consent or consents executed by the noninterested or noncommon directors or in other records of the corporation; and (3) the noninterested directors or noncommon directors, as applicable, 				 approve the action by a vote that is sufficient without counting the votes of the interested directors or common directors.
(c) Each director shall have one vote on each matter presented to the board of directors for action. A director shall not vote by proxy.
(d) This section applies also to incorporators, to committees of the board, and to action by those incorporators or committees mutatis mutandis.

The bylaws may authorize one or more such committees, each consisting of two or more directors, and may provide that a specified officer or officers who are also directors of the corporation shall be a member or members of such committee or committees. The board may appoint one or more directors as alternate members of such committee, who may replace 				 any absent member at any meeting of the committee. Such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the board or in the bylaws, shall have all the authority of the board, except with respect to:

(c) The provisions of this section, and not Section 9243, shall govern any action or omission of a director in regard to the compensation of directors, as directors or officers, or any loan of money or property to or guaranty of the obligation of any director or officer.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the court may order the director to do any or all of the following:
(1) Account for any profits made from the transaction, and pay them to the corporation.
(2) Pay the corporation the value of the use of any of its property used in the transactions.
(3) Return or replace any property lost to the corporation as a result of the transaction, together with any income or appreciation lost to the corporation by reason of the transaction, or account for any proceeds of sale of the property, and pay the proceeds to the corporation together with interest at the legal rate.
The court may award prejudgment interest to the extent allowed in Sections 3287 and 3288 of the Civil Code. In addition, the court may, in its discretion, grant exemplary damages for a fraudulent or malicious violation of this section.

  (a) No contract or other transaction between a corporation and any domestic or foreign corporation, firm or association of which one or more of its directors are directors is either void or voidable because such director or directors are present at the meeting of the board or a committee thereof which authorizes, approves or ratifies the contract or transaction, if:
(1) The material facts as to the transaction and as to such director’s other directorship are fully disclosed or known to the board or committee, and the board or committee authorizes, approves or ratifies the contract or transaction in good faith by a vote sufficient without counting the vote of the common director or directors; or
(2) As to contracts or transactions not approved as provided in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, the contract or transaction is just and reasonable as to the corporation, taking into account its religious purposes, or is in furtherance of its religious purposes at the time it is authorized, approved or ratified.
(b) This section does not apply to transactions covered by Section 9243.
(Added by Stats. 1979, Ch. 681.)

(c) The damages recoverable from a director under this section shall be the amount of the illegal distribution, or if the illegal distribution consists of property, the fair market value of that property at the time of the illegal distribution, plus interest thereon from the date of the distribution at the legal rate on judgments until paid, together with all reasonably incurred costs of appraisal or other valuation, if any, of that property, or the loss suffered by the corporation as a result of the illegal loan or guaranty.
(d) Any director sued under this section may implead all other directors liable and may compel contribution, either in that action or in an independent action against directors not joined in that action.
(e) Directors liable under this section shall also be entitled to be subrogated to the rights of the corporation as follows:
(1) With respect to paragraph (1) of subdivision (a), against members who received the distribution.
(2) With respect to paragraph (2) of subdivision (a), against the members who received the distribution.

(Amended by Stats. 1999, Ch. 453, Sec. 21. Effective January 1, 2000.)
9246.
  (a) For the purposes of this section, “agent” means any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or other agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee, or agent of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of a foreign or domestic corporation which was a predecessor corporation of the corporation or of another enterprise at the request of that predecessor corporation; “proceeding” means any threatened, 				 pending, or completed action or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative; and “expenses” includes without limitation attorneys’ fees and any expenses of establishing a right to indemnification under subdivision (d) or paragraph (3) of subdivision (e).
(b) A corporation shall have power to indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any proceeding (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor, an action brought under Section 9243, or an action brought by the Attorney General pursuant to Section 9230) by reason of the fact that the person is or was an agent of the corporation, against expenses, judgments, fines, settlements and other 				 amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with 				 the proceeding if 				 the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person believed to be in the best interests of the corporation and, in the case of a criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the conduct of the person was unlawful. The termination of any proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which the person believed to be in the best interests of the corporation or that the person had reasonable cause to believe that 				 the person’s conduct was unlawful.
(c) A corporation shall have power to indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action by or in the right of the corporation, or brought under Section 9243, or brought by the Attorney General pursuant to Section 9230, to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that the person is or was an agent of the corporation, against expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with the defense or settlement of 				 the action if the person acted in good faith, in a manner in which 				 the person believed to be in the best interests of the corporation and with that care, including reasonable inquiry, as an ordinary prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances. No indemnification shall be made under this subdivision:
(1) In respect of any claim, issue, or matter as to which the 				 person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation in the performance of the person’s duty to the corporation, unless and only to the extent that the court in which 				 the proceeding is or was pending shall determine upon application that, in view of all the circumstances of the case, the person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for the expenses which the court shall determine;
(2) Of amounts paid in settling or otherwise disposing of a threatened or pending action, with or without court approval; or
(3) Of expenses incurred in defending a threatened or pending action which is settled or otherwise disposed 				 of without court approval unless it is settled with the approval of the Attorney General.
(d) To the extent that an agent of a corporation has been successful on the merits in defense of any proceeding referred to in subdivision (b) or (c) or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, the agent shall be indemnified against expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the agent in connection therewith.
(e) Except as provided in subdivision (d), any indemnification under this section shall be made by the corporation only if authorized in the specific case, upon a determination that indemnification of the agent is proper in the circumstances because the agent has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in either subdivision (b) or (c) by:
(1) A majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who are 				 not parties to the 				 proceeding;
(2) Approval of the members (Section 5034), with the persons to be indemnified not being entitled to vote thereon; or
(3) The court in which the proceeding is or was pending upon application made by the corporation or the agent or the attorney or other person rendering services in connection with the defense, whether or not the application by the agent, attorney, 				 or other person is opposed by the corporation.
(f) Expenses incurred in defending any proceeding may be advanced by the corporation prior to the final disposition of the proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the agent to repay the amount unless it shall be determined ultimately that the agent is entitled to be indemnified as authorized in this section.
(g) No provision made by a corporation to indemnify its or its 				 subsidiary’s directors or officers for the defense of any proceeding, whether contained in the articles, bylaws, a resolution of members or directors, an agreement or otherwise, shall be valid unless consistent with this section. Nothing contained in this section shall affect any right to indemnification to which persons other than the directors and officers may be entitled by contract or otherwise.
(h) No indemnification or advance shall be made under this section, except as provided in subdivision (d) or paragraph (3) of subdivision (e), in any circumstance where it appears that:
(1) It would be inconsistent with a provision of the articles, 				 bylaws, a resolution of the members or an agreement in effect at the time of the accrual of the alleged cause of action asserted in the proceeding in which the expenses were incurred or other amounts were paid, which prohibits or otherwise limits indemnification; or
(2) It would be inconsistent with any condition expressly imposed by a court in approving a settlement.
(i) A corporation shall have power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any agent of the corporation against any liability asserted against or incurred by the agent in that capacity or arising out of the agent’s status as such whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify the agent against 				 that liability under the provisions of this section; provided, however, that a corporation shall have no power to purchase and maintain insurance to indemnify any agent of the corporation for a violation of Section 9243.
(j) This section does not apply to any proceeding against any trustee, investment manager, or other fiduciary of a pension, deferred compensation, saving, thrift, or other retirement, incentive, or benefit plan, trust, or provision for any or all of the corporation’s directors, officers, employees, and 				 persons providing services to the corporation or any of its subsidiary or related or affiliated corporations, 				 in the person’s capacity as such, even though the 				 person may also be an agent as defined in subdivision (a) of the employer corporation. A corporation shall have power to indemnify the trustee, investment manager or other fiduciary to the extent permitted by subdivision (f) of Section 9140.
(Amended by Stats. 2012, Ch. 61, Sec. 3. (AB 2668) Effective January 1, 2013.)
9247.
  (a) There shall be no personal liability for monetary damages to a third party on the part of a volunteer director or volunteer executive officer of a nonprofit corporation subject to this part, caused by the director’s or officer’s negligent act or omission in the performance of that person’s duties as a director or officer, if all of the following conditions are met:
(1) The act or omission was within the scope of the director’s or executive officer’s duties.
(2) The act or omission was performed in good faith.
(3) The act or omission was not reckless, wanton, intentional, or grossly negligent.
(4) Damages caused by the act or omission are covered pursuant to a liability insurance policy issued to the corporation, either in the form of a general liability policy or a director’s or officer’s liability policy, or personally to the director or executive officer. In the event that the damages are not covered by a liability insurance policy, the volunteer director or volunteer executive officer shall not be personally liable for the damages if the board of directors of the corporation and the person had made all reasonable efforts in good faith to obtain available liability insurance.
(b) “Volunteer” means the rendering of services without compensation. “Compensation” means remuneration whether by way of salary, fee, or other consideration for services rendered. However, the payment of per diem, mileage, or other reimbursement expenses to a director or executive officer does not affect that person’s status as a volunteer within the meaning of this section.
(c) “Executive officer” means the president, vice president, secretary, or treasurer of a corporation, or other individual serving in like capacity, who assists in establishing the policy of the corporation.
(d) Nothing in this section shall limit the liability of the corporation for any damages caused by acts or omissions of the volunteer director or volunteer executive officer.
(e) This section does not eliminate or limit the liability of a director or officer for any of the following:
(1) As provided in Section 9243 or 9245.
(2) In any action or proceeding brought by the Attorney General.
(f) Nothing in this section creates a duty of care or basis of liability for damage or injury caused by the acts or omissions of a director or officer.
(g) This section is only applicable to causes of action based upon acts or omissions occurring on or after January 1, 1988.

(Amended by Stats. 2015, Ch. 56, Sec. 2. (AB 792) Effective January 1, 2016.)

The articles or bylaws may provide any reasonable method of calling, noticing, and holding such meetings or obtaining such approvals.
(b) Anything in subdivision (a) to the contrary notwithstanding, the articles or bylaws may not vary the provisions of subdivision (e) of Section 9411, subdivision (e) of Section 9417 (if proxies are authorized), or Section 9418.
(Amended by Stats. 1981, Ch. 587, Sec. 51.)
9411.
  (a) Subject to the provisions of this chapter, regular and special meetings of members shall be called, noticed, and held as may be ordered by the board. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the notice of a members’ meeting or any report may be sent by electronic communication or other means of remote communication if the board determines it is necessary or appropriate because of an emergency, as defined in paragraph (5) of subdivision (n) of Section 9140. Subject to any limitations in the articles or bylaws of the corporation, if authorized by the board of directors in its sole discretion, and subject to those guidelines and procedures as the board of directors may adopt, members not physically present in person (or, if proxies are allowed, by proxy) 						at a meeting of members may, by electronic transmission by and to the corporation (Sections 20 and 21), electronic video screen communication, conference telephone, or other means of remote communication, participate in a meeting of members, be deemed present in person (or, if proxies are allowed, by proxy), and vote at a meeting of members, subject to subdivision (f).
(b) Special meetings of members for any lawful purpose may be called by the board or the chairperson of the board or the president. In addition, special meetings of members for any lawful purpose may be called by 5 percent or more of the members.
(c) Upon request in writing to the chairperson of the board, president, vice president, or secretary by any person (other than the board) entitled to call a special 						meeting of members, the board shall expeditiously set a reasonable time and place for the meeting and the officer forthwith shall cause notice to be given to the members entitled to vote of the time and place of the meeting. If the notice is not given within 20 days after receipt of the request, the persons entitled to call the meeting may give the notice or the superior court of the proper county shall summarily order the giving of the notice, after notice to the corporation giving it an opportunity to be heard. The court may issue such orders as may be appropriate, including, without limitation, orders designating the time and place of the meeting, the record date for determination of members entitled to vote, and the form of notice.
(d) The transactions of any meeting of members, however called and noticed, and wherever held, are as valid 						as though had at a meeting duly held after regular call and notice, if a quorum is present either in person (or, if proxies are allowed, by proxy), and if, either before or after the meeting, each of the persons entitled to vote, not present in person or by proxy, signs a written waiver of notice or a consent to the holding of the meeting or an approval of the minutes thereof. All such waivers, consents, and approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of and presence at such meeting, except when the person objects, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened and except that attendance at a meeting is not a waiver of any right to object to the consideration of matters required by this part to be 						included in the notice but not so included, if such objection is expressly made at the meeting. Neither the business to be transacted at nor the purpose of any regular or special meeting of members need be specified in any written waiver of notice, consent to the holding of the meeting, or approval of the minutes thereof except as provided in subdivision (e).
(e) Any member approval required under subdivision (b) of Section 9150, Section 9222, Section 5812 (made applicable pursuant to Section 9620), subdivision (a) of Section 9631, subdivision (c) of Section 9640, subdivision (a) of Section 6015 (made applicable pursuant to Section 9640), or subdivision (b) of Section 9680, other than unanimous approval by those entitled to vote, shall be valid only if the general nature of the proposal so approved was stated in the notice of meeting 						or in any written waiver of notice.
(f) A meeting of the members may be conducted, in whole or in part, by electronic transmission by and to the corporation or by electronic video screen communication, conference telephone, or other means of remote communication if the corporation implements reasonable measures: (1) to provide members and proxyholders (if proxies are allowed) a reasonable opportunity to participate in the meeting and to vote on matters submitted to the members, including an opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of the meeting substantially concurrently with those proceedings, (2) if any member or proxyholder (if proxies are allowed) votes or takes other action at the meeting by means of electronic transmission to the corporation, electronic video screen communication, conference telephone, or other means of 						remote communication, to maintain a record of that vote or action in its books and records, and (3) to verify that each person participating remotely is a member or proxyholder (if proxies are allowed). A corporation shall not conduct a meeting of members solely by 						electronic transmission by and to the corporation, electronic video screen communication, conference telephone, or other means of remote communication unless one or more of the following conditions apply: (A) all of the members consent, or (B) the board determines it is necessary or appropriate because of an emergency, as defined in paragraph (5) of subdivision (n) of Section 9140; or (C) the meeting is conducted on or before June 30, 2022.
(Amended by Stats. 2022, Ch. 617, Sec. 71. (SB 1202) Effective January 1, 2023.)
9412.
  (a) One-third of the voting power, represented in person, by written ballot, or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of members. If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the majority of the voting power represented at the meeting, entitled to vote, and voting on any matter shall be the act of the members.
(b) The members present at a duly called or held meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to transact business until adjournment notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough members to leave less than a quorum, if any action taken (other than adjournment) is approved by at least a majority of the members required to constitute a quorum or, if required by this division, or by the articles or the bylaws, the vote of the greater number or voting by classes.
(c) In the absence of a quorum, any meeting of members may be adjourned from time to time by the vote of a majority of the votes represented either in person or by proxy, but no other business may be transacted, except as provided in subdivision (b).
(Amended by Stats. 2000, Ch. 485, Sec. 15. Effective January 1, 2001.)
9413.
  (a) Any action which may be taken at any regular or special meeting of members may be taken without a meeting if the written ballot of every member is solicited, if the required number of signed approvals in writing, setting forth the action so taken, is received, and if the requirements of subdivision (c) are satisfied. Unless otherwise provided by the articles or bylaws and if approved by the board of directors, that ballot and any related material may be sent by electronic transmission by the corporation (Section 20) and responses may be returned to the corporation by electronic transmission to the corporation (Section 21).
(b) All solicitations of ballots shall indicate the time by which the ballot must be returned to be counted.
(c) Approval by written ballot pursuant to this section shall be valid only when the number of ballots cast on or before the time the ballot must be returned to be counted equals or exceeds the quorum required to be present at a meeting authorizing the action, and the number of approvals equals or exceeds the number of votes that would be required to approve at a meeting at which the total number of votes cast was the same as the number of ballots cast.
(d) A written ballot may not be revoked.
(e) Directors may be elected by written ballot under this section, where authorized by the articles or bylaws, except that election by written ballot may not be authorized where the directors are elected by cumulative voting pursuant to Section 9415.
(Amended by Stats. 2004, Ch. 254, Sec. 33. Effective January 1, 2005.)
9414.
  (a) If for any reason it is impractical or unduly difficult for any corporation to call or conduct a meeting of its members, delegates or directors, or otherwise obtain their consent, in the manner prescribed by its articles or bylaws, or this part, then the superior court of the proper county, upon petition of a director, officer, delegate, or member, may order that such a meeting be called or that a written ballot or other form of obtaining the vote of members, delegates or directors be authorized, in such a manner as the court finds fair and equitable under the circumstances.
(b) The court shall, in an order issued pursuant to this section, provide for a method of notice reasonably designed to give actual notice to all parties who would be entitled to notice of a meeting held pursuant to the articles, bylaws and this part, whether or not the method results in actual notice to every such person, or conforms to the notice requirements that would otherwise apply.

(c) The court, consistent with the provisions of this part and in conformity with the articles and bylaws to the extent feasible, may determine the person entitled to the office of director or may order a new election to be held or appointment to be made, may determine the validity of the issuance of memberships and the right of persons to vote and may direct such other relief as may be just and proper.

(b) If the name signed on a ballot, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment does not correspond to the record name of a member, the corporation if acting in good faith is nevertheless entitled to accept the ballot, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment and give it effect as the act of the member if any of the following occur:
(1) The member is an entity and the name signed purports to be that of an officer or agent of the entity.

Such certificate of correction shall be signed and verified or acknowledged as provided in this part with respect to the agreement, certificate or other instrument being corrected. It shall set forth the following:
(a) The name or names of the corporation or corporations.
(b) The date the agreement, certificate or other instrument being corrected was filed.
(c) The provision in the agreement, certificate or other instrument as corrected and, if the execution was defective, wherein it was defective.
The filing of the certificate of correction shall not alter the effective 				time of the agreement, certificate or other instrument being corrected, which shall remain as its original effective time, and such filing shall not affect any right or liability accrued or incurred before such filing, except that any right or liability accrued or incurred by reason of the error or defect being corrected shall be extinguished by such filing if the person having such right has not detrimentally relied on the original instrument.

  (a) Upon receipt of any instrument by the Secretary of State for filing pursuant to this part, if it conforms to law, it shall be filed by, and in the office of the Secretary of State and the date of filing endorsed thereon. Except for instruments filed pursuant to Section 12570 the date of filing shall be the date the instrument is received by the Secretary of State unless the instrument provides that it is to be withheld from filing until a future date or unless in the judgment of the Secretary of State the filing is intended to be coordinated with the filing of some other corporate document which cannot be filed. The Secretary of State shall file a document as of any requested future date not more than 90 days after its receipt, including a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, if the document is received in the Secretary of 						State’s office at least one business day prior to the requested date of filing. An instrument does not fail to conform to law because it is not accompanied by the full filing fee if the unpaid portion of such fee does not exceed the limits established by the policy of the Secretary of State for extending credit in such cases.
(b) If the Secretary of State determines that an instrument submitted for filing or otherwise submitted does not conform to law and returns it to the person submitting it, the instrument may be resubmitted accompanied by a written opinion of a member of the State Bar of California submitting the instrument, or representing the person submitting it, to the effect that the specific provision of the instrument objected to by the Secretary of State does conform to law and stating the points and authorities upon which the opinion is based. The Secretary of State shall rely, with respect to any disputed point of law (other than 						the application of Section 12302), upon such written opinion in determining whether the instrument conforms to law. The date of filing in such case shall be the date the instrument is received on resubmission.
(c) Any instrument filed with respect to a corporation (other than original articles) may provide that it is to become effective not more than 90 days subsequent to its filing date. In case such a delayed effective date is specified, the instrument may be prevented from becoming effective by a certificate stating that by appropriate corporate action it has been revoked and is null and void, executed in the same manner as the original instrument and filed before the specified effective date. In the case of a merger agreement, such certificate revoking the earlier filing need only be executed on behalf of one of the constituent corporations. If no such revocation certificate is filed, the instrument becomes effective on the date 						specified.
(d) Any instrument submitted to the Secretary of State for filing pursuant to this part by a domestic corporation or foreign corporation that is qualified to transact business in California under Section 2105 shall include the entity name and number as they exist on the Secretary of State’s records.
(Amended by Stats. 2020, Ch. 361, Sec. 10. (SB 522) Effective January 1, 2021.)

  The Secretary of State may cancel the filing of articles if a check or other remittance accepted in payment of the filing fee or franchise tax is not paid upon presentation. Within 90 days of receiving written notification that the item presented for payment has not been honored for payment, the Secretary of State shall give written notice of the applicability of this section and the cancellation date which shall be not less than 20 days from the date of mailing the written notice as certified by the Secretary of State, to the agent for service of process or to the person submitting the instrument. Thereafter, if the amount has not been paid by cashier’s check or equivalent before the date of cancellation as stated in the 						written notice of cancellation, the cancellation shall thereupon be effective.
(Amended by Stats. 2022, Ch. 617, Sec. 73. (SB 1202) Effective January 1, 2023.)
12214.6.
  (a) A corporation that (1) fails to file a statement pursuant to Section 12570 for an applicable filing period, (2) has not filed a statement pursuant to Section 12570 during the preceding 24 months, and (3) was certified for penalty pursuant to Section 12670 for the same filing period of the prior year, shall be subject to suspension pursuant to this section rather than to a penalty under Section 12670.
(b) When subdivision (a) is applicable, the Secretary of State shall mail a 				notice to the corporation informing the corporation that its corporate powers, rights, and privileges will be suspended 60 days from the date of the notice if the corporation does not file the statement required by Section 12570.

(1) Meetings of the board may be called by the chair of the board or the president or any vice president or the secretary or any two directors.

Special meetings of the board shall be held upon four days’ notice by first-class mail or 48 hours’ notice delivered personally or by telephone, including a voice messaging system or by electronic transmission by the corporation (Section 20). The articles or bylaws may not dispense with notice of a special meeting. A notice, or waiver of notice, need not specify 				 the purpose of any regular or special meeting of the board.
(3) Notice of a meeting need not be given to any director who provides a waiver of notice or consent to holding the meeting or an approval of the minutes thereof in writing, whether before or after the meeting, or who attends the meeting without protesting, prior thereto or at its commencement, the lack of notice to that director. All waivers, consents, and approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meetings.
(4) A majority of the directors present, whether or not a quorum is present, may adjourn any meeting to another time and place. If the meeting is adjourned for more than 24 hours, notice of any adjournment to another time or place shall be given prior to the time of the adjourned meeting to the directors who were not present at the time of the adjournment.
(5) Meetings of the directors may be held at any place within or without the state which has been designated in the notice of the meeting or, if not stated in the notice or if there is no notice, designated in the bylaws or by resolution of the board.
(6) Directors may participate in a meeting through use of conference telephone, electronic video screen communication, or electronic transmission by and to the corporation (Sections 20 and 21). Participation in a meeting through use of conference telephone or electronic video screen communication pursuant to this subdivision constitutes presence in person at that meeting as long as all directors participating in the meeting are able to hear one another.

(A) Each director participating in the meeting can communicate with all of the other directors concurrently.

(7) A majority of the number of directors authorized in or pursuant to the articles or bylaws constitutes a quorum of the board for the transaction of business. The articles or bylaws may require the presence of one or more specified directors to constitute a quorum of the board to transact business, as long as the death or nonexistence of a specified director or the death or nonexistence of the 				 person or persons otherwise authorized to appoint or designate a director does not prevent the corporation from transacting business in the normal course of events. The articles or bylaws may not provide that a quorum shall be less than one-fifth the number of directors authorized in or pursuant to the articles or bylaws, or less than two, whichever is larger.
(8) Subject to the provisions of Sections 12352, 12373, 12374, and subdivision (e) of Section 12377, every act or decision done or made by a majority of the directors present at a meeting duly held at which a quorum is present is the act of the board. The articles or bylaws may not provide that a lesser vote than a majority of the directors present at a meeting is the act of the board. A meeting at which a quorum is initially present may continue to transact business notwithstanding the withdrawal of directors, if any action taken is approved by at least a majority of the required quorum 				 for the meeting, or a greater number as is required by this division, the articles or bylaws.
(b) Any action required or permitted to be taken by the board may be taken without a meeting, if all directors shall individually or collectively consent in writing to that action. Such written consent or consents shall be filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the board.
The action by written consent shall have the same force and effect as a unanimous vote of the directors.
(c) Each director shall have one vote on each matter presented to the board of directors for action. A director shall not vote by proxy.

The bylaws may authorize one or more such committees, each consisting of two or more directors, and may provide that a specified officer or officers who are also directors of the corporation shall be a member or members of such committee or committees. The board may appoint one or more directors as alternate members of such 				 committee, who may replace any absent member at any meeting of the committee.

Any 						number of offices may be held by the same person unless the articles or bylaws provide otherwise. Either the chair of the board or the president shall be elected from among those board members elected by the membership of the corporation.
(b) Except as otherwise provided by the articles or bylaws, officers shall be chosen by the board and serve at the pleasure of the board, subject to the rights, if any, of an officer under any contract of employment.

ARTICLE 2. Selection, Removal and Resignation of Directors [12360 - 12364]  ( Article 2 added by Stats. 1982, Ch. 1625, Sec. 3. )

12360.
  (a) Except as provided in subdivision (d), directors shall be elected for terms of not longer than four years, as fixed in the articles or bylaws. In the absence of any provision in the articles or bylaws, the terms shall be one year. No amendment of the articles or bylaws may extend the term of a director beyond that for which the director was elected, nor may any bylaw provision increasing the terms of directors be adopted without approval of the members.
(b) Unless otherwise provided in the articles or bylaws, each director, including a director elected to fill a vacancy, shall hold office until the expiration of the term for which elected and until a successor has been elected 						and qualified, unless the director has been removed from office.
(c) The articles or bylaws may prescribe requirements for eligibility for election as a director.
(d) For the purposes of this subdivision, “designator” means one or more designators. Notwithstanding subdivisions (a) to (c), inclusive, all or any portion of the directors authorized in the articles or bylaws of a corporation may hold office by virtue of designation or selection by a specified designator as provided by the articles or bylaws rather than by election. Those directors shall continue in office for the term prescribed by the governing article or bylaw provision, or, if there is no term prescribed, until the governing article or bylaw provision is duly amended or repealed, except as provided in subdivision 						(f) of Section 12362. A bylaw provision authorized by this subdivision may be adopted, amended, or repealed only by approval of the members (Section 12224), except as provided in subdivision (d) of Section 12330. Unless otherwise provided in the articles or bylaws, the entitlement to designate or select a director or directors shall cease if any of the following circumstances exist:
(1) The specified designator of that director or directors has died or ceased to exist.
(2) If the entitlement of the specified designator of that director or directors to designate is in the capacity of an officer, trustee, or other status and the office, trust, or status has ceased to exist.
(e) If a corporation has not issued memberships 						and (1) all the directors resign, die, or become incompetent, or (2) a corporation’s initial directors have not been named in the articles and all incorporators resign, die, or become incompetent before the election of the initial directors, the superior court of any county may appoint directors of the corporation upon application by any party in interest.
(f) If authorized in the articles or bylaws of a corporation, all or any portion of the directors may hold office ex officio by virtue of occupying a specified position within the corporation or outside the corporation. The term of office of an ex officio director shall coincide with that director’s respective term 						of office in the specified position entitling him or her to serve on the board of directors. Upon an ex officio director’s resignation or removal from that position, or resignation or removal from the board for any reason, the term of office as a director of the corporation shall immediately cease. At that time, the successor in office shall become an ex officio director of the corporation, occupying the place of the former director.
(Amended by Stats. 2018, Ch. 322, Sec. 5. (AB 2557) Effective January 1, 2019.)
12361.
  The board may declare vacant the office of a director whose eligibility for election as a director has ceased, or who has been declared of unsound mind by a final order of court, or convicted of a felony, or, if at the time a director is elected, the bylaws provide that a director may be removed for missing a specified number of board meetings, fails to attend the specified number of meetings.
(Added by Stats. 1982, Ch. 1625, Sec. 3. Operative January 1, 1984.)
12362.
  (a) Subject to subdivisions (b), (c) and (g), any or all directors may be removed without cause if one of the following applies:
(1) In a corporation with fewer than 50 members, the removal is approved by a majority of all members (Section 12223).
(2) In a corporation with 50 or more members, the removal is approved by the members (Section 12224).
(b) In a corporation in which the articles or bylaws authorize members to cumulate their votes pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 12485, no director may be removed (unless the entire board is removed) when the votes cast against removal, or not 				 consenting in writing to the removal, would be sufficient to elect the director if voted cumulatively at an election at which the same total number of votes were cast (or, if the action is taken by written ballot, all memberships entitled to vote were voted) and the entire number of directors authorized at the time of the director’s most recent election were then being elected; and
(c) When by the provisions of the articles or bylaws the members of any class, voting as a class, are entitled to elect one or more directors, any director so elected may be removed only by the applicable vote of the members of that class.
(d) Any reduction of the authorized number of directors or any amendment reducing the number of class of directors does not remove any director prior to the expiration of the director’s term of office, unless the reduction or amendment also provides for removal of one 				 or more specified directors.
(e) Except as provided in this section and Sections 12361 and 12363, a director may not be removed prior to the expiration of the director’s term of office.
(f) Where a director removed under this section or Section 12361 or 12363 was chosen by designation pursuant to subdivision (d) of Section 12360, then:
(1) Where a different person may be designated pursuant to the governing article or bylaw provision, the new designation shall be made; or
(2) Where the governing article or bylaw provision contains no provision under which a different person may be designated, the governing article or bylaw provision shall be deemed repealed.
(g) For the purposes of this 				 subdivision, “designator” means one or more designators. If by the provisions of the articles or bylaws a designator is entitled to designate one or more directors, then:
(1) Unless as otherwise provided in the articles or bylaws at the time of designation, any director so designated may be removed without cause by the designator of that director.
(2) Any director so designated may only be removed under subdivision (a) with the written consent of the designator of that director.
(3) Unless as otherwise provided in the articles or bylaws, the right to remove shall not apply if any of the following circumstances exist:
(A) The designator entitled to that right has died or ceased to exist.
(B) If that right is in the capacity of an officer, trustee, or other status, and the office, trust, or status has ceased to exist.
(Amended by Stats. 2009, Ch. 631, Sec. 47. (AB 1233) Effective January 1, 2010.)
12363.
  The superior court of the proper county may, at the suit of a director, or members possessing 5 percent of the voting power, remove from office any director in case of fraudulent or dishonest acts or gross abuse of authority or discretion with reference to the corporation and may bar from reelection any director so removed for a period prescribed by the court. The corporation shall be made a party to such action.
(Added by Stats. 1982, Ch. 1625, Sec. 3. Operative January 1, 1984.)
12364.
  (a) Unless otherwise provided in the articles or bylaws and except for a vacancy created by the removal of a director, vacancies on the board may be filled by approval of the board (Section 12222) or, if the number of directors then in office is less than a quorum, by (1) the unanimous written consent of the directors then in office, (2) the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office at a meeting held pursuant to notice or waivers of notice complying with Section 12351, or (3) a sole remaining director. Unless the articles or a bylaw approved by the members (Section 12224) provide that the board may fill vacancies occurring in the board by reason of the removal of directors, such vacancies 						may be filled only by approval of the members (Section 12224).
(b) The members may elect a director at any time to fill any vacancy not filled by the directors.
(c) Any director may resign effective upon giving written notice to the chairperson of the board, the president, the secretary, or the board of directors of the corporation, unless the notice specifies a later time for the effectiveness of such resignation. If the resignation is effective at a future time, a successor may be elected to take office when the resignation becomes effective.

ARTICLE 3. Standards of Conduct [12370 - 12377]  ( Article 3 added by Stats. 1982, Ch. 1625, Sec. 3. )

12370.
  Any duties and liabilities set forth in this article shall apply without regard to whether a director is compensated by the corporation.
(Added by Stats. 1982, Ch. 1625, Sec. 3. Operative January 1, 1984.)
12371.
  (a) A director shall perform the duties of a director, including duties as a member of any committee of the board upon which the director may serve, in good faith, in a manner such director believes to be in the best interests of the corporation and with such care, including reasonable inquiry, as an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances.
(b) In performing the duties of a director, a director shall be entitled to rely on information, opinions, reports or statements, including financial statements and other financial data, in each case prepared or presented by:
(1) One or more officers or employees of the corporation 				 whom the director believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented;
(2) Counsel, independent accountants or other persons as to matters which the director believes to be within such person’s professional or expert competence; or
(3) A committee upon which the director does not serve that is composed exclusively of any or any combination of directors, persons described in paragraph (1), or persons described in paragraph (2), as to matters within the committee’s designated authority, which committee the director believes to merit confidence, so long as, in any such case, the director acts in good faith, after reasonable inquiry when the need therefor is indicated by the circumstances and without knowledge that would cause such reliance to be unwarranted.
(c) A person who performs the duties of a director 				 in accordance with subdivisions (a) and (b) shall have no liability based upon any alleged failure to discharge the persons’s obligations as a director.
(Amended by Stats. 2009, Ch. 631, Sec. 48. (AB 1233) Effective January 1, 2010.)
12372.
  (a) Section 12371 governs the duties of directors as to any acts or omissions in connection with the election, selection, or nomination of directors.
(b) This section shall not be construed to limit the generality of Section 12371.
(Added by Stats. 1982, Ch. 1625, Sec. 3. Operative January 1, 1984.)
12373.
  (a) No contract or other transaction between a corporation and one or more of its directors, or between a corporation and any domestic or foreign corporation, firm or association in which one or more of its directors has a material financial interest, is either void or voidable because such director or directors or such other corporation, business corporation, firm or association are parties or because such director or directors are present at the meeting of the board or a committee thereof which authorizes, approves or ratifies the contract or transaction, if:
(1) The material facts as to the transaction and as to such director’s interest are fully disclosed or known to the members and such contract or transaction is approved by the members (Section 12224) in good faith, with any membership owned by any interested director not being entitled to vote thereon;
(2) The material facts as to the transaction and as to such director’s interest are fully disclosed or known to the board or committee, and the board or committee authorizes, approves or ratifies the contract or transaction in good faith by a vote sufficient without counting the vote of the interested director or directors and the contract or transaction is just and reasonable as to the corporation at the time it is authorized, approved or ratified; or
(3) As to contracts or transactions not approved as provided in paragraph (1) or (2), the person asserting the validity of the contract or transaction sustains the burden of proving that the contract or transaction was just and reasonable as to the corporation at the time it was authorized, approved or ratified.
Neither a mere common directorship nor a member-patron relationship on terms available to all members constitutes a material financial interest within the meaning of this subdivision. A director is not interested within the meaning of this subdivision in a resolution fixing the compensation of another director as a director, officer or employee of the corporation, notwithstanding the fact that the first director is also receiving compensation from the corporation.
(b) No contract or other transaction between a corporation and any corporation, business corporation or association of which one or more of its directors are directors is either void or voidable because such director or directors are present at the meeting of the board or a committee thereof which authorizes, approves or ratifies the contract or transaction, if:
(1) The material facts as to the transaction and as to such director’s other directorship are fully disclosed or known to the board or committee, and the board or committee authorizes, approves or ratifies the contract or transaction in good faith by a vote sufficient without counting the vote of the common director or directors or the contract or transaction is approved by the members in good faith; or
(2) As to contracts or transactions not approved as provided in paragraph (1), the contract or transaction is just and reasonable as to the corporation at the time it is authorized, approved or ratified.
This subdivision does not apply to contracts or transactions covered by subdivision (a).
(Added by Stats. 1982, Ch. 1625, Sec. 3. Operative January 1, 1984.)
12374.
  Interested or common directors may be counted in determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting of the board or a committee thereof which authorizes, approves or ratifies a contract or transaction as provided in Section 12373.
(Added by Stats. 1982, Ch. 1625, Sec. 3. Operative January 1, 1984.)
12375.
  (a) Unless prohibited by the articles or bylaws, a corporation may loan money or property to, or guarantee the obligation of, any director or officer of the corporation or of its parent, affiliate or subsidiary, provided:
(1) The board determines the loan or guaranty may reasonably be expected to benefit the corporation.
(2) Prior to consummating the transaction or any part thereof, the loan or guaranty is either:
(A) Approved by the members (Section 12224), without counting the vote of the director or officer, if a member.
(B) Approved by the vote of a majority of the directors then in office, without counting the vote of the director who is to receive the loan or the benefit of the guaranty.
(b) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), a corporation may advance money to a director or officer of the corporation or of its parent, affiliate or subsidiary, for any expenses reasonably anticipated to be incurred in the performance of the duties of the director or officer of the corporation or of its parent, affiliate or subsidiary, for any expenses reasonably anticipated to be incurred in the performance of the duties of the director or officer, provided that in the absence of such an advance the director or officer would be entitled to be reimbursed for these expenses by the corporation, its parent, affiliate, or subsidiary.
(c) The provisions of subdivisions (a) and (b) do not apply to credit unions, or to the payment of premiums in whole or in part by a corporation on a life insurance policy on the life of a director or officer so long as repayment to the corporation of the amount paid by it is secured by the proceeds of the policy and its cash surrender value, or to loans permitted under any statute regulating any special class of corporations.
(Repealed and added by Stats. 1983, Ch. 792, Sec. 17.)
12376.
  (a) Subject to the provisions of Section 12371, directors of a corporation who approve any of the following corporate actions are jointly and severally liable to the corporation for the benefit of all of the creditors entitled to institute an action under paragraph (1) or (2) of subdivision (c) or to the corporation in an action by members under paragraph (3) of subdivision (c):
(1) The making of any distribution or purchase or redemption of memberships contrary to Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 12450).
(2) The distribution of assets after institution of dissolution proceedings of the corporation, without paying or adequately providing for all known liabilities of the corporation, excluding any claims not filed by creditors within the time limit set by the court in a notice given to creditors under Chapters 15 (commencing with Section 12620), 16 (commencing with Section 12630), and 17 (commencing with Section 12650).
(3) The making of any loan or guarantee contrary to Section 12375.
(b) A director who is present at a meeting of the board, or any committee thereof, at which action specified in subdivision (a) is taken and who abstains from voting shall be considered to have approved the action.
(c) Suit may be brought in the name of the corporation to enforce the liability:
(1) Under paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) against any or all directors liable by the persons entitled to sue under subdivision (c) of Section 12455.
(2) Under paragraph (2) or (3) of subdivision (a) against any or all directors liable by any one or more creditors of the corporation whose debts or claims arose prior to the time of the corporate action who have not consented to the corporate action, whether or not they have reduced their claims to judgment.
(3) Under paragraph (3) of subdivision (a) against any or all directors liable by any one or more members at the time of any corporate action specified in paragraph (3) of subdivision (a) who have not consented to the corporate action, without regard to the provisions of Section 12490.
(d) The damages recoverable from a director under this section shall be the amount of the illegal distribution, or if the illegal distribution consists of property, the fair market value of that property at the time of the illegal distribution, plus interest thereon from the date of the distribution at the legal rate on judgments until paid, together with all reasonably incurred costs of appraisal or other valuation, if any, of that property, or the loss suffered by the corporation as a result of the illegal loan or guarantee, but not exceeding, in the case of an action for the benefit of creditors, the liabilities of the corporation owed to nonconsenting creditors at the time of the violation.
(e) Any director sued under this section may implead all other directors liable and may compel contribution, either in that action or in an independent action against directors not joined in that action.
(f) Directors liable under this section shall also be entitled to be subrogated to the rights of the corporation:
(1) With respect to paragraph (1) of subdivision (a), against the persons who received the distribution.
(2) With respect to paragraph (2) of subdivision (a), against the persons who received the distribution.
(3) With respect to paragraph (3) of subdivision (a), against the person who received the loan or guarantee.
Any director sued under this section may file a cross-complaint against the person or persons who are liable to the director as a result of the subrogation provided for in this subdivision or may proceed against them in an independent action.
(Amended by Stats. 1999, Ch. 453, Sec. 25. Effective January 1, 2000.)
12377.
  (a) For the purposes of this section, “agent” means any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or other agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or was a director, officer, employee or agent of a foreign or domestic corporation which was a predecessor corporation of the corporation or of another enterprise at the request of the predecessor corporation; “proceeding” means any threatened, pending or completed 				 action or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative; and “expenses” includes without limitation attorneys’ fees and any expenses of establishing a right to indemnification under subdivision (d) or paragraph (3) of subdivision (e).
(b) A corporation shall have power to indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any proceeding (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor) by reason of the fact that the person is or was an agent of the corporation, against expenses, judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with 				 the proceeding if 				 the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the corporation and, in the case of a criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the conduct of the person was unlawful. The termination of any proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner 				 that the person reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the corporation or that the person had reasonable cause to believe that the person’s conduct was unlawful.
(c) A corporation shall have power to indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action by or in the right of the corporation, to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that the person is or was an agent of the corporation, against expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the 				 person in connection with the defense or settlement of the action if 				 the person acted in good faith, in a manner the person believed to be in the best interests of the corporation and with that care, including reasonable inquiry, as an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances. No indemnification shall be made under this subdivision:
(1) In respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which 				 the person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation in the performance of 				 the person’s duty to the corporation, unless and only to the extent that the court in which the proceeding is or was pending shall determine upon application that, in view of all the circumstances of the case, the person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for the expenses which the court shall determine;
(2) Of 				 amounts paid in settling or otherwise disposing of a threatened or pending action, with or without court approval; or
(3) Of expenses incurred in defending a threatened or pending action which is settled or otherwise disposed of without court approval.
(d) To the extent that an agent of a corporation has been successful on the merits in defense of any proceeding referred to in subdivision (b) or (c) or in defense of any claim, issue, or matter therein, the agent shall be indemnified against expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the agent in connection therewith.
(e) Except as provided in subdivision (d), any indemnification under this section shall be made by the corporation only if authorized in the specific case, upon a determination that indemnification of the agent is proper in the circumstances because 				 the agent has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in subdivision (b) or (c), by:
(1) A majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who are not parties to the proceeding;
(2) Approval of the members (Section 12224), with the persons to be indemnified not being entitled to vote thereon; or
(3) The court in which the proceeding is or was pending upon application made by the corporation or the agent or the attorney 				 or other person rendering services in connection with the defense, whether or not 				 the application by the agent, attorney or other person is opposed by the corporation.
(f) Expenses incurred in defending any proceeding may be advanced by the corporation prior to the final disposition of the proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the agent to repay the amount unless it shall be determined ultimately that the agent is entitled to be indemnified as authorized in this section.
(g) No provision made by a corporation to 				 indemnify its or its subsidiary’s directors or officers for the defense of any proceeding, whether contained in the articles, bylaws, a resolution of members or directors, an agreement or otherwise, shall be valid unless consistent with this section. Nothing contained in this section shall affect any right to indemnification to which persons other than 				 the directors and officers may be entitled by contract or otherwise.
(h) No indemnification or advance shall be made under this section, except as provided in subdivision (d) or paragraph (3) of subdivision (e), in any circumstance where it appears:
(1) That it would be inconsistent with a provision of the articles, bylaws, a resolution of the members or an agreement in effect at the time of the accrual of the alleged cause of action asserted in the proceeding in which the expenses were incurred or other amounts were paid, which prohibits or otherwise limits indemnification; or
(2) That it would be inconsistent with any condition expressly imposed by a court in approving a settlement.
(i) A corporation shall have 				 power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any agent of the corporation against any liability asserted against or incurred by the agent in that capacity or arising out of the agent’s status as such whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify the agent against that liability under the provisions of this section.
(j) This section does not apply to any proceeding against any trustee, investment manager, or other fiduciary 				 of 				 a pension, deferred compensation, saving, thrift, or other retirement, incentive, or benefit plan, trust, or provision for any or all of the corporation’s directors, officers, employees, and persons providing services to the corporation or any of its subsidiary or related or affiliated corporations, 				 in the 				 person’s capacity as such, even though the person may also be an agent as defined in subdivision (a) of the employer corporation. A corporation shall have power to indemnify the trustee, investment manager or other fiduciary to the extent permitted by subdivision (e) of Section 				 12320.

(Repealed and added by Stats. 1982, Ch. 1625, Sec. 3. Operative January 1, 1984.)
12401.
  (a) A corporation may issue, but is not required to issue, membership certificates. In the event that membership certificates are issued, the certificates shall state the information required to be contained in the disclosure document described in subdivision (b). Nothing in this section shall restrict a corporation from issuing identity cards or similar devices to members which serve to identify members qualifying to use facilities or services of the corporation.
(b) Except as provided in subdivision (e), prior to issuing a membership, the corporation shall provide the purchaser of a membership with a disclosure document. The disclosure document may be a prospectus, offering circular, brochure, or similar document, a specimen copy of the membership certificate, or a receipt which the corporation proposes to issue. The disclosure document shall contain the following information:
(1) A statement that the corporation is a cooperative corporation.
(2) A statement that a copy of the corporation’s articles and bylaws will be furnished without charge to a member or prospective member upon written request, and the address of the office of the corporation and the address to which such a written request is to be directed.
(3) If there are restrictions imposed by the corporation upon the transfer of membership, a statement to that effect and the restrictions imposed on transfer.
(4) If the corporation may levy dues, assessments, or membership or transfer fees, a statement to that effect and the conditions under which the corporation may make such a levy.
(5) If the member is required to contribute services to the corporation, a statement to that effect and the amount and nature of the services to be contributed to the corporation.

(8) In lieu of specifying verbatim in the disclosure document the restrictions on the transfer of a membership, conditions of levy, amount and nature of services to be contributed, conditions under which memberships are redeemable, or the rules by which the voting power and proprietary rights of members are to be determined, the disclosure document may contain a statement that such information will be provided free of charge to a member or prospective member who requests it in writing. If the disclosure document contains such a statement it shall also set forth the address of the office of the corporation and the address to which such a request is to be directed.
(c) If the articles or bylaws are amended so that any statement required by subdivision (a) on outstanding membership certificates is no longer accurate, the board may cancel the outstanding certificates and issue in their place new certificates conforming to the articles or bylaws amendments.
(d) When new membership certificates are issued in accordance with subdivision (c), the board may order holders of outstanding certificates to surrender and exchange them for new certificates within a reasonable time fixed by the board. The board may further provide that the holder of the certificate to be surrendered shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of membership until the certificate is surrendered, but such rights shall be suspended only after notice of the order is given to the holder of the certificate and only until the certificate is surrendered. The requirement to surrender outstanding certificates may be enforced by civil action.
(e) A corporation shall issue a membership certificate, receipt, or written advice of purchase to anyone purchasing a membership upon the member’s first purchase of a membership of any class. No disclosure document need be provided to an existing member prior to the purchase of additional memberships if that member has previously been provided with a disclosure document which is accurate and correct as of the date of the purchase of the additional memberships.
(f) If a corporation does not issue new certificates as contemplated by subdivisions (c) and (d), and if a transferee of a membership certificate has not previously been provided with a disclosure statement which is accurate and correct as of the date of registration of the transfer, then the corporation shall provide a disclosure document to the transferee upon registration with the corporation of the transfer of the certificate.
(Amended by Stats. 1983, Ch. 792, Sec. 19.)

12430.
  (a) A member may resign from membership at any time, although the articles or bylaws may require reasonable notice before the resignation is effective.
(b) This section shall not relieve the resigning member from any obligation for charges incurred, services or benefits actually rendered, dues, assessments or fees, or arising from contract, a condition to ownership of land, an obligation arising out of the ownership of land, or otherwise, and this section shall not diminish any right of the corporation to enforce any such obligation or obtain damages for its breach.
(c) A membership issued for a period of time shall expire when such period of time has elapsed unless the membership is renewed.
(Added by Stats. 1982, Ch. 1625, Sec. 3. Operative January 1, 1984.)

  (a) No member may be expelled or suspended, and no membership or memberships may be terminated or suspended, except according to procedures satisfying the requirements of this section. An expulsion, termination, or suspension not in accord with this section shall be void and without effect.
(b) Any expulsion, suspension, or termination must be done in good faith and in a fair and reasonable manner. Any procedure that conforms to the requirements of subdivision (c) or (d) is fair and reasonable, but a court may also find other procedures to be fair and reasonable when the full circumstances of the suspension, termination, or expulsion are considered.
(c) A procedure is fair and reasonable if all of the following occur:
(1) The provisions of the procedure have been set forth in the articles or bylaws, or copies of such provisions are sent annually to all the members as required by the articles or bylaws.
(2) It provides the giving of 15 days’ prior notice of the expulsion, suspension, or termination and the reasons therefor.
(3) It provides an opportunity for the member to be heard, orally or in writing, not less than five days before the effective date of the expulsion, suspension, or termination by a person or body authorized to decide that the proposed expulsion, termination, or suspension not take place.

(e) Any action challenging an expulsion, suspension, or termination of membership, including any claim alleging defective notice, must be commenced within one year after the date of the expulsion, suspension, or termination. In the event such an action is successful the court may order any relief, including reinstatement, it finds equitable under the circumstances, but no vote of the members or of the board may be set aside solely because a person was at the time of the vote wrongfully excluded by virtue of the challenged expulsion, suspension, or termination, unless the court finds further that the wrongful expulsion, suspension, or termination was in bad faith and for the purpose, and with the effect, of 				 wrongfully excluding the member from the vote or from the meeting at which the vote took place, so as to affect the outcome of the vote.
(f) This section governs only the procedures for expulsion, suspension, or termination and not the substantive grounds therefor. An expulsion, suspension, or termination based upon substantive grounds which violate contractual or other rights of the member or are otherwise unlawful is not made valid by compliance with this section.

Unless called to the attention of the member and agreed to in writing by the member, article or bylaw provisions authorizing such dues, assessments or fees do not, of themselves, create such liability. No action shall be brought by or on behalf of any creditor to levy or to require the levy of dues, assessments or fees upon the members of the corporation.
(Added by Stats. 1982, Ch. 1625, Sec. 3. Operative January 1, 1984.)

(b) All creditors of the corporation, with or without reducing their claims to judgment, may intervene in any such creditor’s action to reach and apply unpaid amounts due the corporation and any or all members who owe amounts to the corporation may be joined in such action. Several judgments may be rendered for and against the parties to the action or in favor of a receiver for the benefit of the respective parties thereto.
(c) All amounts paid by any member in any such action shall be credited on the unpaid balance due the corporation by such member.
(Added by Stats. 1982, Ch. 1625, Sec. 3. Operative January 1, 1984.)
12444.
  Nothing in this part shall be construed as in derogation of any rights or remedies which any creditor or member may have against any promoter, member, director, officer or the corporation because of participation in any fraud or illegality practiced upon such creditor or member by any such person or by the corporation or in derogation of any rights which the corporation may have by rescission, cancellation or otherwise because of any fraud or illegality practiced on it by any such person.

(b) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), no proprietary interest shall become the property of the corporation under this section unless the following requirements are satisfied:
(1) The articles or bylaws shall specifically provide for the transfer of ownership of the otherwise escheated proprietary interests to the corporation.
(2) At least 60 days prior notice of the proposed transfer of the proprietary interest to the corporation is given to the affected member by first-class or second-class mail to the last address of the member shown on the corporation’s records, and by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the corporation has its principal office. Notice given in the foregoing manner shall be deemed actual notice.
(3) No proprietary interest shall become the property of the 						corporation under this section if written notice objecting thereto is received by the corporation from the affected member prior to the date of the proposed transfer.
(c) For purposes of this section, a “proprietary interest” shall mean and include any membership, membership certificate, membership share, or share certificate of any class or series representing a proprietary interest in, and issued by, the corporation together with all accrued and unpaid dividends and patronage distributions relating thereto.

12460.
  (a) Meetings of members may be held at a place within or without this state that is stated in or fixed in accordance with the bylaws. If no other place is so stated or fixed, meetings of members shall be held at the principal office of the corporation. Subject to any limitations in the articles or bylaws of the corporation, if authorized by the board of directors in its sole discretion, and subject to those guidelines and procedures as the board of directors may adopt, members not physically present in person at a meeting of members may, by electronic transmission by and to the corporation (Sections 20 and 21), electronic video screen communication, conference telephone, or other means of remote communication, participate in a meeting of 						members, be deemed present in person, and vote at a meeting of members, subject to subdivision (f).
(b) Except as provided in Section 12460.5, a regular meeting of members shall be held annually. In any year in which directors are elected, the election shall be held at the regular meeting unless the directors are chosen in some other manner authorized by law. Any other proper business may be transacted at the meeting.
(c) If a corporation fails to hold the regular meeting for a period of 60 days after the date designated therefor or, if no date has been designated, for a period of 15 months after the formation of the corporation or after its last regular meeting, or if the corporation fails to hold a written ballot for a period of 60 days after the date designated therefor, then the 						superior court of the proper county may summarily order the meeting to be held or the ballot to be conducted upon the application of a member, after notice to the corporation giving it an opportunity to be heard.
(d) The votes represented at a meeting called or by written ballot ordered pursuant to subdivision (c) and entitled to be cast on the business to be transacted shall constitute a quorum, notwithstanding any provision of the articles or bylaws or provision in this part to the contrary. The court may issue such orders as may be appropriate including, without limitation, orders designating the time and place of the meeting, the record date for determination of members entitled to vote, and the form of notice of the meeting.

A worker cooperative shall provide notice of the meeting not less than 48 hours before the meeting if the meeting is a meeting of only worker-members, provided that the notice is delivered personally to every worker-member. Subject to subdivision (f), and 						subdivision (b) of Section 12462, that notice shall state the place, date, and time of the meeting, the means of electronic transmission by and to the corporation (Sections 20 and 21), electronic video screen communication, conference telephone, or other means of remote communication, if any, by which members may participate in that meeting, and (1) in the case of a special meeting, the general nature of the business to be transacted, and no other business may be transacted, or (2) in the case of the regular meeting, those matters which the board, at the time the notice is given, intends to present for action by the members, but, except as provided in subdivision (b) of Section 12462, any proper matter may be presented at the meeting for such action. The notice of any meeting at which directors are to be elected shall include the names of all those who are nominees at the time the notice is given 						to members.
(b) (1) Notice of a members’ meeting or any report shall be given personally, by electronic transmission by the corporation, or by mail or other means of written communication, addressed to a member at the address of such member appearing on the books of the corporation or given by the member to the corporation for purpose of notice, or if no such address appears or is given, at the place where the principal office of the corporation is located or by publication at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the principal office is located. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the notice of a members’ meeting or any report may be sent by electronic communication or other means of remote communication if the board determines it is necessary or appropriate because of an emergency, as defined 						in paragraph (5) of subdivision (m) of Section 12320. An affidavit of giving of any notice or report as permitted because of an emergency or otherwise in accordance with the provisions of this part, executed by the secretary, assistant secretary, or any transfer agent, shall be prima facie evidence of the giving of the notice or report.
(2) If any notice or report addressed to the member at the address of such member appearing on the books of the corporation is returned to the corporation by the United States Postal Service marked to indicate the United States Postal Service is unable to deliver the notice or report to the member at such address, all future notices or reports shall be deemed to have been duly given without further mailing if the same shall be available for the member upon written demand of the member at the principal office 						of the corporation for a period of one year from the date of the giving of the notice or report to all other members.
(3) (A) Notice given by electronic transmission by the corporation under this subdivision shall be valid only if it complies with Section 20. Notwithstanding the foregoing, notice shall not be given by electronic transmission by the corporation under this subdivision after either of the following:
(i) The corporation is unable to deliver two consecutive notices to the member by that means.
(ii) The inability to so deliver the notices to the member becomes known to the secretary, any assistant secretary, the transfer agent, or other person responsible for the giving of the 						notice.
(B) This paragraph shall not apply if notices are provided by electronic communication or other means of remote communication as permitted because of an emergency.
(c) Upon request in writing to the corporation addressed to the attention of the chairperson of the board, president, vice president, or secretary by any person (other than the board) entitled to call a special meeting of members, the officer forthwith shall cause notice to be given to the members entitled to vote that a meeting will be held at a time fixed by the board not less than 35 nor more than 90 days after the receipt of the request. If the notice is not given within 20 days after receipt of the request, the persons entitled to call the meeting may give the notice or the superior court of the proper county 						shall summarily order the giving of the notice, after notice to the corporation giving it an opportunity to be heard. The court may issue such orders as may be appropriate, including, without limitation, orders designating the time and place of the meeting, the record date for determination of members entitled to vote, and the form of notice.
(d) When a members’ meeting is adjourned to another time or place, unless the bylaws otherwise require and except as provided in this subdivision, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof (or the means of electronic transmission by and to the corporation or electronic video screen communication, conference telephone, or other means of remote communication, if any, by which members may participate) are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the 						adjourned meeting the corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than 45 days or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each member of record entitled to vote at the meeting.
(e) The transactions of any meeting of members however called and noticed, and wherever held, are as valid as though had at a 						meeting duly held after regular call and notice, if a quorum is present, and if, either before or after the meeting, each of the persons entitled to vote, not present in person, provides a waiver of notice or consent to the holding of the meeting or an approval of the minutes thereof in writing. All such waivers, consents, and approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of and presence at such meeting, except when the person objects, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened and except that attendance at a meeting is not a waiver of any right to object to the consideration of matters required by this part to be included in the notice but not so included, if such objection is expressly 						made at the meeting. Neither the business to be transacted at nor the purpose of any regular or special meeting of members need be specified in any written waiver of notice, consent to the holding of the meeting, or approval of the minutes thereof, unless otherwise provided in the articles or bylaws, except as provided in subdivision (f).
(f) Any approval of the members required under Section 12362, 12364, 12373, 12502, or 12658 other than unanimous approval by those entitled to vote, shall be valid only if the general nature of the proposal so approved was stated in the notice of meeting or in any written waiver of notice.
(g) A court may find that notice not given in conformity with this section is still valid, if it was given in a fair and reasonable manner.
(h) Subject to the provisions of subdivision (i), and unless prohibited by the articles or bylaws, before any regular or special meeting of members, the board may authorize distribution of a written ballot to every member entitled to vote at the meeting. Such ballot shall set forth the action proposed to be taken at the meeting, shall provide an opportunity to specify approval or disapproval of the proposed action, and shall state that unless revoked by the member voting in person at the meeting, the ballot will be counted if received by the corporation on or before the time of the meeting with respect to which it was sent. If ballots are so distributed with respect to a meeting, the number of members voting at the meeting by unrevoked written ballots shall be deemed present at the meeting for purposes of determining the existence of a 						quorum pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 12462 but only with respect to the proposed action referred to in the ballots. These ballots shall be distributed in a manner consistent with the requirements of subdivision (b) and Section 12464.
(i) Unless prohibited by the articles or bylaws, written ballots may be distributed in a manner contemplated by subdivision (h) with respect to the election of directors, except that no ballots may be so distributed with respect to the election of directors if cumulative voting is permitted pursuant to Section 12484.

12462.
  (a) The lesser of 250 members or members representing 5 percent of the voting power, shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of members, but, subject to subdivisions (b) and (c), a bylaw may set a different quorum. Any bylaw amendment to increase the quorum may be adopted only by approval of the members (Section 12224). If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the majority of the voting power represented at the meeting, entitled to vote, and voting on any matter shall be the act of the members unless the vote of a greater number or voting by classes is required by this part or the articles or bylaws.
(b) Where a corporation is authorized to conduct a meeting with a quorum of less than one-third of the voting power, then the only matters that may be voted upon at any regular meeting actually attended by less than one-third of the voting power are matters notice of the general nature of which was given, pursuant to the first sentence of subdivision (a) of Section 12461.
(c) Subject to subdivision (b), the members present at a duly called or held meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to transact business until adjournment notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough members to leave less than a quorum, if any action taken (other than adjournment) is approved by at least a majority of the members required to constitute a quorum or, if required by this division or the articles or the bylaws, the vote of the greater number or voting by classes.
(d) In the absence of a quorum, any meeting of members may be adjourned from time to time by the vote of a majority of the votes represented in person, but no other business may be transacted, except as provided in subdivision (c).

12463.
  (a) Subject to subdivision (e), and unless prohibited in the articles or bylaws any action which may be taken at any regular or special meeting of members may be taken without a meeting if the corporation distributes a written ballot to every member entitled to vote on the matter. Unless otherwise provided by the articles or bylaws and if approved by the board of directors, that ballot and any related material may be sent by electronic transmission by the corporation (Section 20) and responses may be returned to the corporation by electronic transmission to the corporation (Section 21). That ballot shall set forth the proposed action, provide an opportunity to specify approval or disapproval of any proposal, and provide a reasonable time within which to return the ballot to the corporation.
(b) Approval by written ballot pursuant to this section shall be valid only when the number of votes cast by ballot within the time period specified equals or exceeds the quorum required to be present at a meeting authorizing the action, and the number of approvals equals or exceeds the number of votes that would be required to approve at a meeting at which the total number of votes cast was the same as the number of votes cast by ballot.
(c) Ballots shall be solicited in a manner consistent with the requirements of subdivision (b) of Section 12461 and Section 12464. All such solicitations shall indicate the number of responses needed to meet the quorum requirement and, with respect to ballots other than for the election of directors, shall state the percentage of approvals necessary to pass the measure submitted. The solicitation must specify the time by which the ballot must be received in order to be counted.
(d) Unless otherwise provided in the articles or bylaws, a written ballot may not be revoked.
(e) Directors may be elected by written ballot under this section, where authorized by the articles or bylaws, except that election by written ballot may not be authorized where the directors are elected by cumulative voting pursuant to Section 12484. When directors are to be elected by written ballot and the articles or bylaws prescribe a nomination procedure, the procedure may provide for a date for the close of nominations prior to printing and distributing of the written ballots.
(f) The secretary shall cause a vote to be taken by written ballot upon any action or recommendation proposed in writing by 20 percent of the members of the corporation.
(Amended by Stats. 2004, Ch. 254, Sec. 40. Effective January 1, 2005.)
12464.
  (a) Any form of written ballot distributed to 10 or more members of a corporation with 100 or more members shall afford an opportunity on the form of written ballot to specify a choice between approval and disapproval of each matter or group of related matters intended, at the time the written ballot is distributed, to be acted upon by such written ballot, and shall provide, subject to reasonable specified conditions, that where the person solicited specifies a choice with respect to any such matter the vote shall be cast in accordance therewith.
(b) In any election of directors, any form of written ballot in which the directors to be voted upon are named therein as candidates and which is marked by a member “withhold” or otherwise marked in a manner indicating that the authority to vote for the election of directors is withheld shall not be voted for the election of a director.
(c) Failure to comply with this section shall not invalidate any corporate action taken, but may be the basis for challenging any written ballot and the superior court may compel compliance therewith at the suit of any member.
(Added by Stats. 1982, Ch. 1625, Sec. 3. Operative January 1, 1984.)
12465.
  (a) If for any reason it is impractical or unduly difficult for any corporation to call or conduct a meeting of its members, delegates or directors, or otherwise obtain their consent, in the manner prescribed by its articles or bylaws, or this part, then the superior court of the proper county, upon petition of a director, officer, delegate or member, may order that such a meeting be called or that a written ballot or other form of obtaining the vote of members, delegates or directors be authorized, in such a manner as the court finds fair and equitable under the circumstances.
(b) The court shall, in an order issued pursuant to this section, provide for a method of notice reasonably designed to give actual notice to all parties who would be entitled to notice of a meeting held pursuant to the articles, bylaws and this part, whether or not the method results in actual notice to every such person, or conforms to the notice requirements that would otherwise apply. In a proceeding under this section the court may determine who the members or directors are.
(c) The order issued pursuant to this section may dispense with any requirement relating to the holding of and voting at meetings or obtaining of votes, including any requirement as to quorums or as to the number or percentage of votes needed for approval, that would otherwise be imposed by the articles, bylaws, or this part.
(d) Wherever practical any order issued pursuant to this section shall limit the subject matter of the meetings or other forms of consent authorized to items, including amendments to the articles or bylaws, the resolution of which will or may enable the corporation to continue managing its affairs without further resort to this section. However, an order under this section may also authorize the obtaining of whatever votes and approvals are necessary for the dissolution, merger, sale of assets or reorganization of the corporation.
(e) Any meeting or other method of obtaining the vote of members, delegates or directors conducted pursuant to an order issued under this section, and which complies with all the provisions of such order, is for all purposes a valid meeting or vote, as the case may be, and shall have the same force and effect as if it complied with every requirement imposed by the articles, bylaws, and this part.
(Amended by Stats. 1986, Ch. 766, Sec. 34.)
12466.
  (a) If the name signed on a ballot, consent or waiver corresponds to the name of a member, the corporation if acting in good faith is entitled to accept the ballot, consent, or waiver and give it effect as the act of the member.
(b) If the name signed on a ballot, consent, or waiver does not correspond to the record name of a member, the corporation if acting in good faith is nevertheless entitled to accept the vote, consent, or waiver and give it effect as the act of the member if any of the following occur:
(1) The member is an entity and the name signed purports to be that of an officer or agent of the entity.
(2) The name signed purports to be that of an attorney-in-fact of the member and if the corporation requests, evidence acceptable to the corporation of the signatory’s authority to sign for the member has been presented with respect to the vote, consent or waiver.
(3) Two or more persons hold the membership as cotenants or fiduciaries and the name signed purports to be the name of at least one of the coholders and the person signing appears to be acting on behalf of all the coholders.
(c) The corporation is entitled to reject a ballot, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment if the secretary or other officer or agent authorized to tabulate votes, acting in good faith, has a reasonable basis for doubt concerning the validity of the signature or the signatory’s authority to sign for the member.
(d) The corporation and any officer or agent thereof who accepts or rejects a ballot, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment in good faith and in accordance with the standards of this section shall not be liable in damages to the member for the consequences of the acceptance or rejection.
(e) Corporate action based on the acceptance or rejection of a ballot, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment under this section is valid unless a court of competent jurisdiction determines otherwise.

(Added by Stats. 1982, Ch. 1625, Sec. 3. Operative January 1, 1984.)

  (a) Except as provided in subdivision (c), no corporation may decline to publish or mail material, otherwise required to be published or mailed on behalf of any nominee under this article, on the basis of the content of such material.
(b) Neither the corporation, nor its agents, officers, directors, or employees, may be held criminally liable, liable for any negligence (active or passive) or otherwise liable for damages to any person on account of any material which is supplied by a nominee for director and which it mails or publishes pursuant to Section 12473 or 12474 but the nominee on whose behalf such material was published or mailed shall be liable and shall indemnify and hold the corporation, its agents, officers, directors, and employees and each of them harmless from all demands, costs, including reasonable legal fees and expenses, claims, damages and causes of action arising out of such material or any such mailing or publication.
(c) Nothing in this section shall prevent a corporation or any of its agents, officers, directors, or employees from seeking a court order relieving the corporation from its obligation under Section 12473 or 12474 on the ground the material will expose the moving party to liability.
(Added by Stats. 1982, Ch. 1625, Sec. 3. Operative January 1, 1984.)
12476.
  Without authorization of the board, no corporation funds may be expended to support a nominee for director after there are more people nominated for director than can be elected.
(Added by Stats. 1982, Ch. 1625, Sec. 3. Operative January 1, 1984.)
12477.
  An action challenging the validity of any election, appointment or removal of a director or directors must be commenced within nine months after the election, appointment or removal. If no such action is commenced, in the absence of fraud, any election, appointment or removal of a director is conclusively presumed valid nine months thereafter if the only defect in the election, appointment or removal is the failure to give notice as provided in this part or in the corporation’s articles or bylaws.

CHAPTER 6. Voting of Memberships [12480 - 12485]  ( Chapter 6 added by Stats. 1982, Ch. 1625, Sec. 3. )

12480.

(Added by Stats. 1982, Ch. 1625, Sec. 3. Operative January 1, 1984.)
12481.
  (a) The bylaws may provide or, in the absence of such provision, the board may fix, in advance, a date as the record date for the purpose of determining the members entitled to notice of any meeting of members. Such record date shall not be more than 60 nor less than 10 days before the date of the meeting. If no record date is fixed, members at the close of business on the business day preceding the day on which notice is given or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the business day preceding the day on which the meeting is held are entitled to notice of a meeting of members. A determination of members entitled to notice of a meeting of members shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting unless the board fixes a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
(b) The bylaws may provide or, in the absence of such provision, the board may fix, in advance, a date as the record date for the purpose of determining the members entitled to vote at a meeting of members. Such record date shall not be more than 60 days before the date of the meeting. Such record date shall also apply in the case of an ajournment of the meeting unless the board fixes a new record date for the adjourned meeting. If no record date is fixed, members on the day of the meeting who are otherwise eligible to vote are entitled to vote at the meeting of members or, in the case of an adjourned meeting, members on the day of the adjourned meeting who are otherwise eligible to vote are entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting of members.
(c) The bylaws may provide or, in the absence of such provision, the board may fix, in advance, a date as the record date for the purpose of determining the members entitled to cast written ballots (Section 12463). Such record date shall not be more than 60 days before the day on which the first written ballot is mailed or solicited. If no record date is fixed, members on the day the first written ballot is mailed or solicited who are otherwise eligible to vote are entitled to cast written ballots.
(d) The bylaws may provide or, in the absence of such provision, the board may fix, in advance, a date as the record date for the purpose of determining the members entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any other lawful action. Such record date shall not be more than 60 days prior to such other action.

(a) If only one 				 vote, such act binds all; or
(b) If more than one vote, the act of the majority so voting binds all.

If inspectors of election are not so appointed, or if any persons so appointed fail to appear or refuse to act, the chairperson of any meeting of members may, and on the request of any member shall, appoint inspectors of election (or persons to replace those who so fail or refuse) at the meeting. The number of inspectors shall be either one or three. If appointed at a meeting on the request of one or more members, the majority of members represented in person shall determine whether one or three inspectors are to be appointed.
(b) The inspectors of election shall determine the number of memberships outstanding and the voting power of each, the number represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, receive votes, ballots or consents, hear and determine all challenges and questions in any way arising in connection with the right to vote, count and tabulate all votes or consents, determine when the polls shall close, determine the result and do such acts as may be proper to conduct the election or vote with fairness to all members.
(c) The inspectors of election shall perform their duties impartially, in good faith, to the best of their ability and as expeditiously as is practical. If there are three inspectors of election, the decision, act or certificate of a majority is effective in all respects as the decision, act or certificate of all. Any report or certificate 						made by the inspectors of election is prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.

12484.
  (a) Except in the case of a central organization, cumulative voting shall not be permitted. In the case of a central organization, if the articles or bylaws authorize cumulative voting, but not otherwise, every member entitled to vote at any election of directors may cumulate such member’s votes and give one candidate a number of votes equal to the number of directors to be elected multiplied by the number of votes to which the member is entitled, or distribute the member’s votes on the same principle among as many candidates as the member thinks fit. An article or bylaw provision authorizing cumulative voting may be repealed or amended only by approval of the members (Section 12224), except that the governing article or bylaw provision may require the vote of a greater proportion of the members, or of the members of any class, for its repeal.
(b) No member shall be entitled to cumulate votes for a candidate or candidates unless such candidate’s name or candidates’ names have been placed in nomination prior to the voting and the member has given notice at the meeting prior to the voting of the member’s intention to cumulate votes. If any one member has given such notice, all members may cumulate their votes for candidates in nomination.
(c) In any election of directors of a central organization by cumulative voting, the candidates receiving the highest number of votes are elected, subject to any lawful provision specifying election by classes. In any other election of directors, unless otherwise provided in the articles or bylaws, the candidates receiving the highest number of votes are elected.
(d) Elections for directors need not be by ballot unless a member demands election by ballot at the meeting and before the voting begins or unless the bylaws so require.
(Amended by Stats. 1984, Ch. 812, Sec. 17.5.)
12485.
  (a) Upon the filing of an action therefor by any director or member or by any person who had the right to vote in the election at issue, the superior court of the proper county shall determine the validity of any election or appointment of any director of any corporation.
(b) Upon the filing of the complaint, and before any further proceedings are had, the court shall enter an order fixing a date for the hearing, which shall be within five days unless for good cause shown a later date is fixed, and requiring notice of the date for the hearing and a copy of the complaint to be served upon the corporation and upon the person whose purported election or appointment is questioned and upon any person (other than the plaintiff) whom the plaintiff alleges to have been elected or appointed, in the manner in which a summons is required to be served, or, if the court so directs, by registered mail; and the court may make such further requirements as to notice as appear to be proper under the circumstances.
(c) The court, consistent with the provisions of this part and in conformity with the articles and bylaws to the extent feasible, may determine the person entitled to the office of director or may order a new election to be held or appointment to be made, may determine the validity, effectiveness and construction of voting agreements and voting trusts, the validity of the issuance of memberships and the right of persons to vote and may direct such other relief as may be just and proper.

CHAPTER 7. Members’ Derivative Actions [12490- 12490.]  ( Chapter 7 added by Stats. 1982, Ch. 1625, Sec. 3. )

12490.
  (a) Subdivisions (c) through (f) notwithstanding, no motion to require security shall be granted in an action brought by the lesser of 100 members or 5 percent of the members.
(b) No action may be instituted or maintained in the right of any corporation by any member of such corporation unless both of the following conditions exist:
(1) The plaintiff alleges in the complaint that plaintiff was a member at the time of the transaction or any part thereof of which plaintiff complains, or that plaintiff’s membership thereafter devolved upon plaintiff by operation of law from a holder who was a holder at the time of transaction or any part thereof complained of; and
(2) The plaintiff alleges in the complaint with particularity plaintiff’s efforts to secure from the board such action as plaintiff desires, or the reasons for not making such effort, and alleges further that plaintiff has either informed the corporation or the board in writing of the ultimate facts of each cause of action against each defendant or delivered to the corporation or the board a true copy of the complaint which plaintiff proposes to file.
(c) Subject to subdivision (a), in any action referred to in subdivision (b), at any time within 30 days after service of summons upon the corporation or upon any defendant who is an officer or director of the corporation, or held such office at the time of the acts complained of, the corporation or such defendant may move the court for an order, upon notice and hearing, requiring the plaintiff to furnish security as hereinafter provided. The motion shall be based upon one or both of the following grounds:
(1) That there is no reasonable possibility that the prosecution of the cause of action alleged in the complaint against the moving party will benefit the corporation or its members economically or otherwise.
(2) That the moving party, if other than the corporation, did not participate in the transaction complained of in any capacity.
The court on application of the corporation or any defendant may, for good cause shown, extend the 30-day period for an additional period or periods not exceeding 60 days.
(d) At the hearing upon any motion pursuant to subdivision (c), the court shall consider such evidence, written or oral, by witnesses or affidavit, as may be material (1) to the ground or grounds upon which the motion is based, or (2) to a determination of the probable reasonable expenses, including attorneys’ fees, of the corporation and the moving party which will be incurred in the defense of the action. If the court determines, after hearing the evidence adduced by the parties, that the moving party has established a probability in support of any of the grounds upon which the motion is based, the court shall fix the nature and amount of security, not to exceed fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), to be furnished by the plaintiff for reasonable expenses, including attorneys’ fees, which may be incurred by the moving party and the corporation in connection with the action, including expenses for which the corporation may become liable pursuant to Section 12377. A ruling by the court on the motion shall not be a determination of any issue in the action or of the merits thereof. The amount of the security may thereafter be increased or decreased in the discretion of the court upon a showing that the security provided has or may become inadequate or is excessive, but the court may not in any event increase the total amount of the security beyond fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) in the aggregate for all defendants. If the court, upon any such motion, makes a determination that security shall be furnished by the plaintiff as to any one or more defendants, the action shall be dismissed as to such defendant or defendants, unless the security required by the court shall have been furnished within such reasonable time as may be fixed by the court. The corporation and the moving party shall have recourse to the security in such amount as the court shall determine upon the termination of the action.
(e) If the plaintiff shall, either before or after a motion is made pursuant to subdivision (c), or any order or determination pursuant to such motion, post good and sufficient bond or bonds in the aggregate amount of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) to secure the reasonable expenses of the parties entitled to make the motion, the plaintiff has complied with the requirements of this section and with any order for security theretofore made pursuant hereto, and any such motion then pending shall be dismissed and no further or additional bond or other security shall be required.
(f) If a motion is filed pursuant to subdivision (c), no pleadings need be filed by the corporation or any other defendant and the prosecution of the action shall be stayed until 10 days after the motion has been disposed of.

12503.

(2) Materially and adversely affect such class as to voting, dissolution, redemption or transfer by changing the rights, 						privileges, preferences, restrictions or conditions of another 						class.
(3) Increase the number of memberships authorized for the class.
(4) Increase the number of memberships authorized for another 						class.
(5) Effect an exchange, reclassification or cancellation of all or part of the memberships of the class.

CHAPTER 12. Required Filings by Corporation or Its Agent [12570 - 12576]  ( Chapter 12 added by Stats. 1982, Ch. 1625, Sec. 3. )

12570.
  (a) Every corporation shall, within 90 days after the filing of its original articles and annually thereafter during the applicable filing period in each year, file, on a form prescribed by the Secretary of State, a statement containing: (1) the name of the corporation and the Secretary of State’s file number; (2) the names and complete business or residence addresses of its chief executive officer or general manager, secretary, and chief financial officer; (3) the street address of its principal office in California, if any; (4) the mailing address of the corporation, if different from the street address of its principal office in California; and (5) if the corporation chooses to receive renewal notices and any other notifications from the 						Secretary of State by electronic mail instead of by United States mail, the corporation shall include a valid electronic mail address for the corporation or for the corporation’s designee to receive those notices.
(b) The statement required by subdivision (a) shall also designate, as the agent of the corporation for the purpose of service of process, a natural person residing in this state or any domestic or foreign corporation that has complied with Section 1505 and whose capacity to act as an agent has not terminated. If a natural person is designated, the statement shall set forth the person’s complete business or residence street address. If a corporate agent is designated, no address for it shall be set forth.
(c) For the purposes of this section, the applicable filing period for 						a corporation shall be the calendar month during which its original articles were filed and the immediately preceding five calendar months. The Secretary of State shall provide a notice to each corporation to comply with this section approximately three months before the close of the applicable filing period. The notice shall state the due date for compliance and shall be sent to the last address of the corporation according to the records of the Secretary of State or to the last electronic mail address according to the records of the Secretary of State if the corporation has elected to receive notices from the Secretary of State by electronic mail. Neither the failure of the Secretary of State to send the notice nor the failure of the corporation to receive it is an excuse for failure to comply with this section.
(d) Whenever any of the 						information required by subdivision (a) is changed, the corporation may file a current statement containing all the information required by subdivisions (a) and (b). In order to change its agent for service of process or the address of the agent, the corporation must file a current statement containing all the information required by subdivisions (a) and (b). Whenever any statement is filed pursuant to this section, it supersedes any previously filed statement and the statement in the articles as to the agent for service of process and the address of the agent.
(e) The Secretary of State may destroy or otherwise dispose of any statement filed pursuant to this section after it has been superseded by the filing of a new statement.
(f) This section does not place any person 						dealing with the corporation on notice of, or under any duty to inquire about, the existence or content of a statement filed pursuant to this section.
(Amended by Stats. 2022, Ch. 617, Sec. 84. (SB 1202) Effective January 1, 2023.)

Thereupon the authority of the agent to act in that capacity shall cease and the Secretary of State forthwith shall mail or otherwise provide written notice of the filing of the statement of resignation to the corporation at its principal office.
(b) The resignation of an agent may be effective if, on a form prescribed by the Secretary of State containing the name of the corporation, the Secretary of State’s file number for the corporation, and the name of the resigning agent for service of process, the agent disclaims having been properly appointed as the agent. Similarly, a person named as an officer or director may indicate that the person was never properly appointed as the officer or director.
(c) The Secretary of State may destroy or otherwise dispose of any resignation filed pursuant to this section after a new form is filed pursuant to Section 12570 replacing the agent for service of process that has resigned.
(Amended by Stats. 2014, Ch. 834, Sec. 18. (SB 1041) Effective January 1, 2015.)
12572.
  If a natural person who has been designated agent for service of process pursuant to Section 12570 dies or resigns or no longer resides in the state or if the corporate agent for such purpose resigns, dissolves, withdraws from the state, forfeits its right to transact intrastate business, has its corporate rights, powers and privileges suspended, or ceases to exist, the corporation shall forthwith file a designation of a new agent conforming to the requirements of Section 12570.

(Amended by Stats. 2004, Ch. 254, Sec. 41. Effective January 1, 2005.)

ARTICLE 3. Rights of Inspection [12600 - 12608]  ( Article 3 added by Stats. 1982, Ch. 1625, Sec. 3. )

12600.
  (a) Subject to Sections 12601 and 12602 and unless the corporation provides a reasonable alternative pursuant to subdivision (c), a member may do either or both of the following as permitted by subdivision (b):
(1) Inspect and copy the record of all the members’ names, addresses, and voting rights, at reasonable times, upon five business days’ prior written demand upon the corporation which demand shall state the purpose for which the inspection rights are requested; or
(2) Obtain from the secretary of the corporation, upon written demand and tender of a reasonable charge, a list of the names, addresses, and voting rights of those members entitled to vote for the election of directors, as of the most recent record date for which it has been compiled or as of a date specified by the member subsequent to the date of demand. The demand shall state the purpose for which the list is requested. The membership list shall be made available on or before the later of 10 business days after the demand is received or after the date specified therein as the date as of which the list is to be compiled.
(b) The rights set forth in subdivision (a) may be exercised by:
(1) A member or members possessing 5 percent or more of the voting power for a purpose reasonably related to the members’ interest as members. Where the corporation reasonably believes that the information will be used for another purpose, or where it provides a reasonable alternative pursuant to subdivision (c), it may deny the member access to the list. In any subsequent action brought by the member under Section 12606 the court shall enforce the rights set forth in subdivision (a) unless the corporation proves that the member will allow use of the information for purposes unrelated to the person’s interest as a member or that the alternative method offered reasonably achieves the proper purpose set forth in the demand.
(c) The corporation may, within 10 business days after receiving a demand under subdivision (a), deliver to the person or persons making the demand a written offer of an alternative method of achieving the purpose identified in the demand without providing access to or a copy of the membership list. An alternative method which reasonably and in a timely manner accomplishes the proper purpose set forth in a demand made under subdivision (a) shall be deemed a reasonable alternative, unless within a reasonable time after acceptance of the offer the corporation fails to do those things which it offered to do. Any rejection of the offer shall be in writing and shall indicate the reasons the alternative proposed by the corporation does not meet the proper purpose of the demand made pursuant to subdivision (a).
(Repealed and added by Stats. 1982, Ch. 1625, Sec. 3. Operative January 1, 1984.)
12601.
  (a) Where the corporation, in good faith, and with a substantial basis, believes that the membership list, demanded by a member or members under Section 12600, will be used for a purpose not reasonably related to the interests as members of the person or persons making the demand (hereinafter called the requesting parties) or provides a reasonable alternative pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 12600 it may petition the superior court of the proper county for an order setting aside the demand.
(b) Except as provided in subdivision (c), a petition for an order to show cause why a protective order pursuant to subdivision (d) should not issue shall be filed within 10 business days after a demand by a member or members under Section 12600 or receipt of a written rejection by the member or members of an offer made pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 12600 whichever is later. The petition shall be accompanied by an application for a hearing on the petition. Upon the filing of the petition, the court shall issue a protective order staying production of the list demanded until the hearing on the order to show cause. The court shall set the hearing on the order to show cause not more than 20 days from the date of the filing of the petition. The order to show cause shall be granted unless the court finds that there is no reasonable probability that the corporation will make the showing required under subdivision (f).
(c) A corporation may file a petition under this section more than 10 business days after the demand or rejection under Section 12600 but only upon a showing the delay was caused by excusable neglect. In no event, however, may any petition under this section be considered if filed more than 30 days after the requesting party’s demand or rejection, whichever is later.
(d) Upon the return day of the order to show cause, the court may issue a protective order staying production of the list demanded until final adjudication of the petition filed pursuant to this section. No protective order shall issue under this subdivision unless the court finds that the rights of the requesting parties can reasonably be preserved and that the corporation is likely to make the showing required by subdivision (f) or the court is likely to issue a protective order pursuant to subdivision (g).
(e) If the corporation fails to file a petition within the time allowed by subdivision (b) or (c), whichever is applicable, or fails to obtain a protective order under subdivision (d), then the corporation shall comply with the demand, and no further action may be brought by the corporation under this section.
(f) The court shall issue the final order setting aside the demand only if the corporation proves:
(1) That there is a reasonable probability that the requesting parties will permit use of the membership list for a purpose unrelated to their interests as members; or
(2) That the method offered by the corporation is a reasonable alternative in that it reasonably achieves the proper purpose set forth in the requesting parties’ demand and that the corporation intends and is able to effectuate the reasonable alternative.
(g) In the final order, the court may, in its discretion, order an alternate mechanism for achieving the proper purposes of the requesting parties, or impose just and proper conditions upon the use of the membership list which reasonably assures compliance with Section 12600 and Section 12608.
(h) The court shall award reasonable costs and expenses including reasonable attorneys’ fees, to requesting parties who successfully oppose any petition or application filed pursuant to this section.
(i) Where the corporation has neither, within the time allowed, complied with a demand by a member or members under Section 12600, nor obtained a protective order staying production of the list, or a final order setting aside the demand, which is then in effect, the requesting parties may petition the superior court of the proper county for a writ of mandamus pursuant to Section 1085 of the Code of Civil Procedure compelling the corporation to comply with the demand. At the hearing, the court shall hear the parties summarily, by affidavit or otherwise, and shall issue a peremptory writ of mandamus unless it appears that the demand was not made by a member or members possessing sufficient voting power, that the demand has been complied with, that the corporation, pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 12600, made an offer which was not rejected in writing within a reasonable time, or that a protective or final order properly issued under subdivision (d), (f) or (g) is then in effect. No inquiry may be made in such proceeding into the use for which the list is sought.
The court shall award reasonable costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, to persons granted an order under this subdivision.
(j) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the right of the corporation to obtain damages for any misuse of a membership list obtained under Section 12600, or otherwise, or to obtain injunctive relief necessary to restrain misuse of a member list. A corporation shall be entitled to recover reasonable costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, incurred in successfully bringing any such action.
(Repealed and added by Stats. 1982, Ch. 1625, Sec. 3. Operative January 1, 1984.)
12602.
  (a) Upon petition of the corporation or any member, the superior court of the proper county may limit or restrict the rights set forth in Section 12600 where, and only where, such limitation or restriction is necessary to protect the rights of any member under the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution of the State of California. An order issued pursuant to this subdivision shall provide, insofar as possible, for alternative mechanisms by which the persons seeking to exercise rights under Section 12600 may communicate with members for purposes reasonably related to their interests as members.
(b) Upon the filing of a petition under subdivision (a), the court may, if requested by the person making the petition, issue a temporary order suspending the running of any time limit specified in Section 12600 for compliance with that section. Such an order may be extended, after notice and hearing, until final adjudication of the petition, wherever it appears that the petitioner may prevail on the merits, and it is otherwise equitable to do so.

12605.
  Where the proper purpose of the person or persons making a demand pursuant to Section 12600 is frustrated by (a) any delay by the corporation in complying with a demand under Section 12600 beyond the time limits specified therein, or (b) any delay caused by the filing of a petition under Section 12601 or Section 12602, or (c) any delay caused by the alternative proposed under subdivision (c) of Section 12600, the person or persons properly making the demand shall have, in the discretion of the court, a right to obtain from the superior court an order postponing any members’ meeting previously noticed for a period equal to the period of such delay. The members may obtain such an order in a proceeding brought pursuant to Section 12601 upon the filing of a verified complaint in the proper county and after a hearing, notice of which shall be given to such persons and in such manner as the court may direct. Such right shall be in addition to any other legal or equitable remedies to which the member may be entitled.
(Added by Stats. 1982, Ch. 1625, Sec. 3. Operative January 1, 1984.)
12606.
  (a) Upon refusal of a lawful demand for inspection under this chapter, or a lawful demand pursuant to Section 12600 or Section 12603, the superior court of the proper county, or the county where the books or records in question are kept, may enforce the demand or right of inspection with just and proper conditions or may, for good cause shown, appoint one or more competent inspectors or independent accountants to audit the financial statements kept in this state and investigate the property, funds and affairs of any corporation and of any subsidiary corporation thereof, domestic or foreign, keeping records in this state and to report thereon in such manner as the court may direct.
(b) All officers and agents of the corporation shall produce to the inspectors or accountants so appointed all books and documents in their custody or power, under penalty of punishment for contempt of court.

(Added by Stats. 1982, Ch. 1625, Sec. 3. Operative January 1, 1984.)
12608.
  (a) A membership list is a corporate asset. Without consent of the board a membership list or any part thereof may not be obtained or used by any person for any purpose not reasonably related to a member’s interest as a member. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, without the consent of the board a membership list or any part thereof may not be:

(3) There is internal dissension and two or more factions of members in the corporation are so deadlocked that its activities can no longer be conducted with advantage.
(4) When during any four-year period or when all voting power has been exercised at two consecutive meetings or in two written ballots for the election of directors, whichever period is shorter, the members have failed to elect successors to directors whose terms have expired or would have expired upon election of their successors.

Any director so appointed by the court shall serve until the next regular meeting of members or until a successor is elected or appointed.

(b) Such notice to creditors shall be published not less than once a week for three consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation published in the county in which the proceeding is pending or, if there is no such newspaper published in that county, in such newspaper as may be designated by the court, directing creditors and claimants to make and present claims and proofs to the person, at the place and within the time specified in the notice. A copy of the notice shall be mailed to each person shown as a creditor or claimant on the books of the corporation, at such person’s last known address.

13402.
  (a) This part shall not apply to any corporation now in existence or hereafter organized which may lawfully render professional services other than pursuant to this part, nor shall anything herein contained alter or affect any right or privilege, whether under any existing or future provision of the Business and Professions Code or otherwise, in terms permitting or not prohibiting performance of professional services through the use of any form of corporation permitted by the General Corporation Law.
(b) The conduct of a business in this state by a corporation pursuant to a license or registration issued under any state law, except laws relating to taxation, shall not be considered to be the conduct of a business as a professional corporation if the business is conducted by, and the license or registration is issued to, a corporation which is not a professional corporation within the meaning of this part, whether or not a professional corporation could conduct the same business, or portions of the same business, as a professional corporation.
(Amended by Stats. 1988, Ch. 919, Sec. 13.)
13403.
  The provisions of the General Corporation Law shall apply to professional corporations, except where such provisions are in conflict with or inconsistent with the provisions of this part. A professional corporation which has only one shareholder need have only one director who shall be such shareholder and who shall also serve as the president and treasurer of the corporation. The other officers of the corporation in such situation need not be licensed persons. A professional corporation which has only two shareholders need have only two directors who shall be such shareholders. The two shareholders between them shall fill the offices of president, vice president, secretary and treasurer.
A professional medical corporation may establish in its articles or bylaws the manner in which its directors are selected and removed, their powers, duties, and compensation. Each term of office may not exceed three years. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the articles or bylaws of a professional medical corporation with more than 200 shareholders may provide that directors who are officers of the corporation or who are responsible for the management of all medical services at one or more medical centers may have terms of office, as directors, of up to six years; however, no more than 50 percent of the members of the board, plus one additional member of the board, may have six-year terms of office.
(Amended by Stats. 1980, Ch. 36.)
13404.
  A corporation may be formed under the General Corporation Law or pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 13406 for the purposes of qualifying as a professional corporation in the manner provided in this part and rendering professional services. The articles of incorporation of a professional corporation shall contain a specific statement that the corporation is a professional corporation within the meaning of this part. Except as provided in subdivision (b) of Section 13401, no professional corporation shall render professional services in this state without a currently effective certificate of registration issued by the governmental agency regulating the profession in which such corporation is or proposes to be engaged, pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Business and Professions Code or the Chiropractic Act expressly authorizing such professional services to be rendered by a professional corporation.

(c) If the California board, commission, or other agency that prescribes the rules or regulations governing a particular profession either now or hereafter requires that the shareholders of the professional corporation bear any degree of personal liability for the acts of the corporation, either by personal guarantee or in some other form that the governing agency prescribes, the shareholders of a foreign corporation that has been qualified to do business in this state in the same profession shall, as a condition of doing business in this state, be subject, with regard to the rendering of professional services by the professional corporation in California, or for California residents, to the same degree of personal liability, if any, as is prescribed by the governing agency for shareholders of a California professional corporation rendering services in the same profession.
(d) Each application by a foreign professional corporation to qualify to do business in this state shall contain the following statement:
“The shareholders of the undersigned foreign professional corporation shall be subject, with regard to the rendering of professional services by the professional corporation in California, or for California residents, to the same degree of personal liability, if any, in California as is from time to time prescribed by the agency governing the profession in this state for shareholders in a California professional corporation rendering services in the same profession. This application accordingly constitutes a submission to the jurisdiction of the courts of California to the same extent, but only to the same extent, as applies to the shareholders of a California professional corporation in the same profession. The foregoing submission to jurisdiction is a condition of qualification to do business in this state.”
(Added by Stats. 1993, Ch. 910, Sec. 3. Effective January 1, 1994.)

A shareholder of a professional corporation or of a foreign 				 professional corporation qualified to render professional services in this state shall not enter into a voting trust, proxy, or any other arrangement vesting another person (other than another person who is a shareholder of the same corporation) with the authority to exercise the voting power of any or all of the shareholder’s shares, and any purported voting trust, proxy, or other arrangement shall be void.

14001.
  (a) It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this chapter to promote the economic development of small businesses through the California Small Business Finance Center by making available capital, general management assistance, and other resources, including financial services, personnel, and business education to small business entrepreneurs, including women, veteran, and minority-owned businesses, for the purpose of promoting the health, safety, and social welfare of the citizens of California, to eliminate unemployment of the economically disadvantaged of the state, and to stimulate economic development and entrepreneurship.
(b) It is the further intent of the Legislature to provide a flexible means to mobilize and 				 commit all available and potential resources in the various regions of the state to fulfill these objectives, including federal, state, and local public resources, and private debt and equity investment.

14550.
  In order to promote, foster, and encourage the intelligent and orderly marketing of agricultural products through cooperation; to eliminate speculation and waste; to make the distribution of agricultural products between producer and consumer as direct as can be efficiently done; and to stabilize the marketing of agricultural products, this act is passed.
(Added by Stats. 1997, Ch. 598, Sec. 8. Effective January 1, 1998.)
14551.
  It is here recognized that agriculture is characterized by individual production in contrast to the group or factory system that characterizes other forms of industrial production; and that the ordinary form of corporate organization permits industrial groups to combine for the purpose of group production and the ensuing group marketing; and that the public has an interest in permitting farmers to bring their industry to the high degree of efficiency and merchandising skill evidenced in the manufacturing industries; and that the public interest urgently needs to prevent the migration from the farm to the city in order to keep up farm production and to preserve the agricultural supply of the nation; and that the public interest demands that the farmer be encouraged to attain a superior and more direct system of marketing in the substitution of merchandising for the blind, unscientific, and speculative selling of crops.

(2) deliver the record to the Secretary of State for filing; or
(3) the Secretary of State to file the record unsigned.
(b) If the person aggrieved under subdivision (a) is not the limited partnership or foreign limited partnership to which the record pertains, the aggrieved person shall make the limited partnership or foreign limited partnership a party to the action. A person aggrieved under subdivision (a) may seek the remedies provided in subdivision (a) in the same action in combination or in the alternative. In any action under this subdivision, if the court finds the failure of the person to comply with the requirement to sign a record or deliver a record to the Secretary of State for filing to have been without justification, the court may award an amount sufficient to reimburse the persons aggrieved under subdivision (a) bringing the action for the reasonable expenses incurred by such persons, including attorneys’ fees, in connection with the action or proceeding.

(b) Except as otherwise provided in Sections 15901.16, 15902.01, and 15902.07, a record delivered to the Secretary of State for filing under this chapter may specify an effective time and a delayed effective date.

(2) if the record specifies a delayed effective date on the earlier of:
(A) the specified date; or
(B) the 90th day after the record is filed; or

This provision shall apply provided that third parties are relying on the acts of the partnership, its partners, employees, and agents. All real and personal property, and all rights and interests, that belong to a limited partnership at the time its certificate of limited partnership was canceled pursuant to Section 15902.03 or that were acquired by the limited partnership following the cancellation of the certificate of limited partnership, that were not disposed of before the time of its revival, shall be vested in the limited partnership after its revival as fully as if they were held by the limited partnership at, and 						during the time after, as the case may be, the time the certificate of limited partnership was canceled. After its revival, the limited partnership and its partners shall have all of the same liability for contracts, acts, matters, and things made, done, or performed in the limited partnership’s name and on behalf of its partners, employees, and agents, as the limited partnership and its partners would have had if the limited partnership’s certificate of limited partnership had at all times remained in full force and effect.

15904.02.
  (a) Each general partner is an agent of the limited partnership for the purposes of its activities. An act of a general partner, including the signing of a record in the partnership’s name, for apparently carrying on in the ordinary course the limited partnership’s activities or activities of the kind carried on by the limited partnership binds the limited partnership, unless the general partner did not have authority to act for the limited partnership in the particular matter and the person with which the general partner was dealing knew, had received a notification, or had notice under subdivision (d) of Section 15901.03 that the general partner lacked authority.

  (a) To the extent not inconsistent with Section 15904.04, a general partner may be joined in an action against the limited partnership or named in a separate action.

(2) the limited partnership is a debtor in bankruptcy;
(3) the general partner has agreed that the creditor need not exhaust limited partnership assets;

(5) liability is imposed on the general partner by law or contract independent of the existence of the limited partnership.

15908.02.
  (a) On application by a partner, a court of competent jurisdiction may order dissolution of a limited partnership if it is not reasonably practicable to carry on the activities of the limited partnership in conformity with the partnership agreement.
(b) In any suit for judicial dissolution, the other partners may avoid the dissolution of the limited partnership by purchasing for cash the partnership interests owned by the partners so initiating the proceeding (the “moving parties”) at their fair market value. In fixing the value, the amount of any damages resulting if the initiation of the dissolution is a breach by any moving party or parties of 						an agreement with the purchasing party or parties, including, without limitation, the partnership agreement, may be deducted from the amount payable to the moving party or parties.
(c) If the purchasing parties (1) elect to purchase the partnership interests owned by the moving parties, (2) are unable to agree with the moving parties upon the fair market value of the partnership interests, and (3) give bond with sufficient security to pay the estimated reasonable expenses, including attorneys’ fees, of the moving parties if the expenses are recoverable under subdivision (d), the court, upon application of the purchasing parties, either in the pending action or in a proceeding initiated in the superior court of the proper county by the purchasing parties, shall stay the winding up and dissolution proceeding and shall proceed to ascertain and 						fix the fair market value of the partnership interests owned by the moving parties.
(d) The court shall appoint three disinterested appraisers to appraise the fair market value of the partnership interests owned by the moving parties, and shall make an order referring the matter to the appraisers so appointed for the purpose of ascertaining that value. The order shall prescribe the time and manner of producing evidence, if evidence is required. The award of the appraisers or a majority of them, when confirmed by the court, shall be final and conclusive upon all parties. The court shall enter a decree that shall provide in the alternative for winding up and dissolution of the limited partnership unless payment is made for the partnership interests within the time specified by the decree. If the purchasing parties do not make payment for the 						partnership interests within the time specified, judgment shall be entered against them and the surety or sureties on the bond for the amount of the expenses, including attorneys’ fees, of the moving parties. Any member aggrieved by the action of the court may appeal therefrom.
(e) If the purchasing parties desire to prevent the winding up and dissolution of the limited partnership, they shall pay to the moving parties the value of their partnership interests ascertained and decreed within the time specified pursuant to this section, or, in the case of an appeal, as fixed on appeal. On receiving that payment or the tender thereof, the moving parties shall transfer their partnership interests to the purchasing parties.
(f) For the purposes of this section, the valuation date shall be 						the date upon which the action for judicial dissolution was commenced. However, the court may, upon the hearing of a motion by any party, and for good cause shown, designate some other date as the valuation date.

  (a) In any derivative action, at any time within 30 days after service of summons upon the limited partnership or the general partner, the limited partnership or general partner may move the court for an order, upon notice and hearing, requiring the plaintiff to furnish a bond as hereinafter provided. The motion shall be based upon one or both of the following grounds:
(1) That there is no reasonable possibility that the prosecution of the cause of action alleged in the complaint against the moving party will benefit the limited partnership or its partners.
(2) That the moving party, if other than the partnership, did not participate in the transaction complained of in any capacity.

A ruling by the court on the motion shall not be a determination of any issue in the action or of the merits thereof. If the court, upon motion, makes a determination that a bond shall be furnished by the plaintiff as to any one or more defendants, the action shall be dismissed as to the defendant or defendants, unless the bond required by the court has been furnished within such reasonable time as may be fixed by the court.

  A partnership is an entity distinct from its partners.
(Added by Stats. 1996, Ch. 1003, Sec. 2. Effective January 1, 1997.)
16202.
  (a) Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (b), the association of two or more persons to carry on as coowners a business for profit forms a partnership, whether or not the persons intend to form a partnership.

(c) In determining whether a partnership is formed, the following rules apply:
(1) Joint tenancy, tenancy in common, tenancy by the entireties, joint property, common property, or part ownership does not by itself establish a partnership, even if the coowners share profits made by the use of the property.
(2) The sharing of gross returns does not by itself establish a partnership, even if the persons sharing them have a joint or common right or interest in property from which the returns are derived.
(3) A person who receives a share of the profits of a business is presumed to be a partner in the business, unless the profits were received for any of the following reasons:

(d) Property acquired in the name of one or more of the partners, without an indication in the instrument transferring title to the property of the person’s capacity as a partner or of the existence of a partnership and without use of partnership assets, is presumed to be separate property, even if used for partnership purposes.

ARTICLE 3. Relations of Partners to Persons Dealing with Partnership [16301 - 16310]  ( Article 3 added by Stats. 1996, Ch. 1003, Sec. 2. )

16301.
  Subject to the effect of a statement of partnership authority under Section 16303 both of the following apply:
(1) Each partner is an agent of the partnership for the purpose of its business. An act of a partner, including the execution of an instrument in the partnership name, for apparently carrying on in the ordinary course the partnership business or business of the kind carried on by the partnership binds the partnership, unless the partner had no authority to act for the partnership in the particular matter and the person with whom the partner was dealing knew or had received a notification that the partner lacked authority.
(2) An act of a partner that is not apparently for carrying on in the ordinary course the partnership business or business of the kind carried on by the partnership binds the partnership only if the act was authorized by the other partners.
(Added by Stats. 1996, Ch. 1003, Sec. 2. Effective January 1, 1997.)
16302.
  (a) Partnership property may be transferred as follows:
(1) Subject to the effect of a statement of partnership authority under Section 16303, partnership property held in the name of the partnership may be transferred by an instrument of transfer executed by a partner in the partnership name.
(2) Partnership property held in the name of one or more partners with an indication in the instrument transferring the property to them of their capacity as partners or of the existence of a partnership, but without an indication of the name of the partnership, may be transferred by an instrument of transfer executed by the persons in whose name the property is held.
(3) Partnership property held in the name of one or more persons other than the partnership, without an indication in the instrument transferring the property to them of their capacity as partners or of the existence of a partnership, may be transferred by an instrument of transfer executed by the persons in whose name the property is held.
(b) A partnership may recover partnership property from a transferee only if it proves that execution of the instrument of initial transfer did not bind the partnership under Section 16301 and either of the following applies:
(1) As to a subsequent transferee who gave value for property transferred under paragraph (1) or (2) of subdivision (a), proves that the subsequent transferee knew or had received a notification that the person who executed the instrument of initial transfer lacked authority to bind the partnership.
(2) As to a transferee who gave value for property transferred under paragraph (3) of subdivision (a), proves that the transferee knew or had received a notification that the property was partnership property and that the person who executed the instrument of initial transfer lacked authority to bind the partnership.
(c) A partnership may not recover partnership property from a subsequent transferee if the partnership would not have been entitled to recover the property, under subdivision (b), from any earlier transferee of the property.
(d) If a person holds all of the partners’ interests in the partnership, all of the partnership property vests in that person. The person may execute a document in the name of the partnership to evidence vesting of the property in that person and may file or record the document.
(Added by Stats. 1996, Ch. 1003, Sec. 2. Effective January 1, 1997.)
16303.
  (a) A partnership may file a statement of partnership authority, which is subject to all of the following:
(1) The statement shall include all of the following:
(A) The name of the partnership.
(B) The street address of its principal office and of one principal office in California, if there is one.
(C) The mailing address of its principal office, if different from the street addresses specified pursuant to subparagraph (B).
(D) The names and 						mailing addresses of all of the partners or of an agent appointed and maintained by the partnership for the purpose of subdivision (b).
(E) The names of the partners authorized to execute an instrument transferring real property held in the name of the partnership.
(2) The statement may specify the authority, or limitations on the authority, of some or all of the partners to enter into other transactions on behalf of the partnership and any other matter.
(b) If a statement of partnership authority names an agent, the agent shall maintain a list of the names and mailing addresses of all of the partners and make it available to any person on request for good cause shown.
(c) If a filed statement of partnership authority is executed pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 16105 and states the name of the partnership but does not contain all of the other information required by subdivision (a), the statement nevertheless operates with respect to a person not a partner as provided in subdivisions (d) and (e).
(d) A filed statement of partnership authority supplements the authority of a partner to enter into transactions on behalf of the partnership as follows:
(1) Except for transfers of real property, a grant of authority contained in a filed statement of partnership authority is conclusive in favor of a person who gives value without knowledge to the contrary, so long as and to the extent that a limitation on that authority is not 						then contained in another filed statement. A filed cancellation of a limitation on authority revives the previous grant of authority.
(2) A grant of authority to transfer real property held in the name of the partnership contained in a certified copy of a filed statement of partnership authority recorded in the office for recording transfers of that real property is conclusive in favor of a person who gives value without knowledge to the contrary, so long as and to the extent that a certified copy of a filed statement containing a limitation on that authority is not then of record in the office for recording transfers of that real property. The recording in the office for recording transfers of that real property of a certified copy of a filed cancellation of a limitation on authority revives the previous grant of authority.
(e) A person not a partner is deemed to know of a limitation on the authority of a partner to transfer real property held in the name of the partnership if a certified copy of the filed statement containing the limitation on authority is of record in the office for recording transfers of that real property.
(f) Except as otherwise provided in subdivisions (d) and (e) and Sections 16704 and 16805, a person not a partner is not deemed to know of a limitation on the authority of a partner merely because the limitation is contained in a filed statement.
(Amended by Stats. 2022, Ch. 617, Sec. 102. (SB 1202) Effective January 1, 2023.)
16304.
  A partner or other person named as a partner in a filed statement of partnership authority or in a list maintained by an agent pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 16303 may file a statement of denial stating the name of the partnership as filed with the Secretary of State, any identification number issued by the Secretary of State, and the fact that is being denied, that may include denial of a person’s authority or status as a partner. A statement of denial is a limitation on authority as provided in subdivisions (d) and (e) of Section 16303.
(Added by Stats. 1996, Ch. 1003, Sec. 2. Effective January 1, 1997.)
16305.
  (a) A partnership is liable for loss or injury caused to a person, or for a penalty incurred, as a result of a wrongful act or omission, or other actionable conduct, of a partner acting in the ordinary course of business of the partnership or with authority of the partnership.
(b) If, in the course of the partnership’s business or while acting with authority of the partnership, a partner receives or causes the partnership to receive money or property of a person not a partner, and the money or property is misapplied by a partner, the partnership is liable for the loss.
(Added by Stats. 1996, Ch. 1003, Sec. 2. Effective January 1, 1997.)
16306.
  (a) Except as otherwise provided in subdivisions (b) and (c), all partners are liable jointly and severally for all obligations of the partnership unless otherwise agreed by the claimant or provided by law.
(b) A person admitted as a partner into an existing partnership is not personally liable for any partnership obligation incurred before the person’s admission as a partner.
(c) Notwithstanding any other section of this chapter, and subject to subdivisions (d), (e), (f), and (h), a partner in a registered limited liability partnership is not liable or accountable, directly or indirectly, including by way of indemnification, contribution, assessment, or otherwise, for debts, obligations, or liabilities of or chargeable to the partnership or another partner in the partnership, whether arising in tort, contract, or otherwise, that are incurred, created, or assumed by the partnership while the partnership is a registered limited liability partnership, by reason of being a partner or acting in the conduct of the business or activities of the partnership.
(d) Notwithstanding subdivision (c), all or certain specified partners of a registered limited liability partnership, if the specified partners agree, may be liable in their capacity as partners for all or specified debts, obligations, or liabilities of the registered limited liability partnership if the partners possessing a majority of the interests of the partners in the current profits of the partnership, or a different vote as may be required in the partnership agreement, specifically agreed to the specified debts, obligations, or liabilities in writing, prior to the debt, obligation, or liability being incurred. That specific agreement may be modified or revoked if the partners possessing a majority of the interests of the partners in the current profits of the partnership, or a different vote as may be required in the partnership agreement, agree to the modification or revocation in writing; provided, however, that a modification or revocation shall not affect the liability of a partner for any debts, obligations, or liabilities of a registered limited liability partnership incurred, created, or assumed by the registered limited liability partnership prior to the modification or revocation.
(e) Nothing in subdivision (c) shall be construed to affect the liability of a partner of a registered limited liability partnership to third parties for that partner’s tortious conduct.
(f) The limitation of liability in subdivision (c) shall not apply to claims based upon acts, errors, or omissions arising out of the rendering of professional limited liability partnership services of a registered limited liability partnership providing legal services unless that partnership has a currently effective certificate of registration issued by the State Bar.
(g) A partner in a registered limited liability partnership is not a proper party to a proceeding by or against a registered limited liability partnership in which personal liability for partnership debts, obligations, or liabilities is asserted against the partner, unless that partner is personally liable under subdivision (d) or (e).
(h) Nothing in this section shall affect or impair the ability of a partner to act as a guarantor or surety for, provide collateral for or otherwise be liable for, the debts, obligations, or liabilities of a registered limited liability partnership.
(Added by Stats. 1996, Ch. 1003, Sec. 2. Effective January 1, 1997.)
16307.
  (a) A partnership may sue and be sued in the name of the partnership.
(b) Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (g) of Section 16306, an action may be brought against the partnership and any or all of the partners in the same action or in separate actions.
(c) A judgment against a partnership is not by itself a judgment against a partner. A judgment against a partnership may not be satisfied from a partner’s assets unless there is also a judgment against the partner.
(d) A judgment creditor of a partner may not levy execution against the assets of the partner to satisfy a judgment based on a claim against the partnership unless any of the following apply:
(1) A judgment based on the same claim has been obtained against the partnership and a writ of execution on the judgment has been returned unsatisfied in whole or in part.
(2) The partnership is a debtor in bankruptcy.
(3) The partner has agreed that the creditor need not exhaust partnership assets.
(4) A court grants permission to the judgment creditor to levy execution against the assets of a partner based on a finding that partnership assets subject to execution are clearly insufficient to satisfy the judgment, that exhaustion of partnership assets is excessively burdensome, or that the grant of permission is an appropriate exercise of the court’s equitable powers.
(5) Liability is imposed on the partner by law or contract independent of the existence of the partnership.
(e) This section applies to any partnership liability or obligation resulting from a representation by a partner or purported partner under Section 16308.
(Added by Stats. 1996, Ch. 1003, Sec. 2. Effective January 1, 1997.)
16308.
  Except with respect to registered limited liability partnerships and foreign limited liability partnerships:
(a) If a person, by words or conduct, purports to be a partner, or consents to being represented by another as a partner, in a partnership or with one or more persons not partners, the purported partner is liable to a person to whom the representation is made, if that person, relying on the representation, enters into a transaction with the actual or purported partnership. If the representation, either by the purported partner or by a person with the purported partner’s consent, is made in a public manner, the purported partner is liable to a person who relies upon the purported partnership even if the purported partner is not aware of being held out as a partner to the claimant. If partnership liability results, the purported partner is liable with respect to that liability as if the purported partner were a partner. If no partnership liability results, the purported partner is liable with respect to that liability jointly and severally with any other person consenting to the representation.
(b) If a person is thus represented to be a partner in an existing partnership, or with one or more persons not partners, the purported partner is an agent of persons consenting to the representation to bind them to the same extent and in the same manner as if the purported partner were a partner, with respect to persons who enter into transactions in reliance upon the representation. If all of the partners of the existing partnership consent to the representation, a partnership act or obligation results. If fewer than all of the partners of the existing partnership consent to the representation, the person acting and the partners consenting to the representation are jointly and severally liable.
(c) A person is not liable as a partner merely because the person is named by another in a statement of partnership authority.
(d) A person does not continue to be liable as a partner merely because of a failure to file a statement of dissociation or to amend a statement of partnership authority to indicate the partner’s dissociation from the partnership.
(e) Except as otherwise provided in subdivisions (a) and (b), persons who are not partners as to each other are not liable as partners to other persons.
(Added by Stats. 1996, Ch. 1003, Sec. 2. Effective January 1, 1997.)
16309.
  (a) The statement of partnership authority may designate an agent for service of process. The agent may be an individual residing in this state or a corporation that has complied with Section 1505 and whose capacity to act as an agent has not terminated. If an individual is designated, the statement shall include that person’s complete business or residence street address in this state. If a corporate agent is designated, no address for that agent shall be set forth.
(b) An agent designated for service of process may deliver to the Secretary of State, on a form prescribed by the Secretary of State for filing, a signed and acknowledged written statement of resignation as an agent 						for service of process containing the name of the partnership and the Secretary of State’s file number of the partnership. On filing of the statement of resignation, the authority of the agent to act in that capacity shall cease and the Secretary of State shall mail or otherwise provide written notice of the filing of the statement of resignation to the partnership at its principal office.
(c) The resignation of an agent may be effective if, on a form prescribed by the Secretary of State containing the name of the partnership and the Secretary of State’s file number for the partnership and the name of the agent for service of process, the agent disclaims having been properly appointed as the agent.
(d) If an individual who has been designated agent for service of process 						dies or resigns or no longer resides in the state, or if the corporate agent for that purpose resigns, dissolves, withdraws from the state, forfeits its right to transact intrastate business, has its corporate rights, powers, and privileges suspended, or ceases to exist, the partnership or foreign partnership shall promptly file an amended statement of partnership authority, designating a new agent.
(e) The Secretary of State may destroy or otherwise dispose of any statement of resignation filed pursuant to this section after a new statement of partnership authority is filed pursuant to Section 16303 replacing the agent for service of process that has resigned.
(Amended by Stats. 2022, Ch. 617, Sec. 103. (SB 1202) Effective January 1, 2023.)
16310.
  (a) If a partnership has designated an agent for service of process, process may be served on the partnership as provided in this section and in Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 413.10) of Title 5 of Part 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
(b) Personal service of a copy of any process against the partnership by delivery to an individual designated by it as agent, or if the designated agent is a corporation, to a person named in the latest certificate of the corporate agent filed pursuant to Section 1505 at the office of the corporate agent, shall constitute valid service on the partnership.
(c) No change in the address of the agent for service of process or appointment of a new agent for service of process shall be effective until an amendment to the statement of partnership authority is filed.
(d) (1) If an agent for service of process has resigned and has not been replaced, or if the designated agent cannot with reasonable diligence be found at the address designated for personal delivery of the process, and it is shown by affidavit to the satisfaction of the court that process against a partnership cannot be served with reasonable diligence upon the designated agent by hand in the manner provided in Section 415.10, subdivision (a) of Section 415.20, or subdivision (a) of Section 415.30 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the court may make an order that the service shall be made on a partnership 						by delivering by hand to the Secretary of State, or to any person employed in the Secretary of State’s office in the capacity of assistant or deputy, one copy of the process for each defendant to be served, together with a copy of the order authorizing the service. Service in this manner shall be deemed complete on the 10th day after delivery of the process to the Secretary of State.
(2) Upon receipt of the copy of process and the fee for service, the Secretary of State shall give notice of the service of the process to the partnership, at its principal office, by forwarding to that office, by registered mail with request for return receipt, the copy of the process.
(3) The Secretary of State shall keep a record of all process served on the Secretary of State under this section 						and shall record therein the time of service and the action taken by the Secretary of State. A certificate under the Secretary of State’s official seal, certifying to the receipt of process, the giving of notice to the partnership, and the forwarding of the process pursuant to this section, shall be competent and prima facie evidence of the service of process.

  Except as provided in Section 16701.5, all of the following shall apply:
(a) If a partner is dissociated from a partnership, the partnership shall cause the dissociated partner’s interest in the partnership to be purchased for a buyout price determined pursuant to subdivision (b).
(b) The buyout price of a dissociated partner’s interest is the amount that would have been distributable to the dissociating partner under subdivision (b) of Section 16807 if, on the date of dissociation, the assets of the partnership were sold at a price equal to the greater of the liquidation value or the value based on a sale of the entire business as a going concern without the dissociated partner and the partnership was wound up as of that date. Interest shall be paid from the date of dissociation to the date of payment.
(c) Damages for wrongful dissociation under Section 16602, and all other amounts owing, whether or not presently due, from the dissociated partner to the partnership, shall be offset against the buyout price. Interest shall be paid from the date the amount owed becomes due to the date of payment.
(d) A partnership shall indemnify a dissociated partner whose interest is being purchased against all partnership liabilities, whether incurred before or after the dissociation, except liabilities incurred by an act of the dissociated partner under Section 16702.
(e) If no agreement for the purchase of a dissociated partner’s interest is reached within 120 days after a written demand for payment, the partnership shall pay, or cause to be paid, in cash to the dissociated partner the amount the partnership estimates to be the buyout price and accrued interest, reduced by any offsets and accrued interest under subdivision (c).
(f) If a deferred payment is authorized under subdivision (h), the partnership may tender a written offer to pay the amount it estimates to be the buyout price and accrued interest, reduced by any offsets under subdivision (c), stating the time of payment, the amount and type of security for payment, and the other terms and conditions of the obligation.
(g) The payment or tender required by subdivision (e) or (f) shall be accompanied by all of the following:
(1) A statement of partnership assets and liabilities as of the date of dissociation.
(2) The latest available partnership balance sheet and income statement, if any.
(3) An explanation of how the estimated amount of the payment was calculated.
(4) Written notice that the payment is in full satisfaction of the obligation to purchase unless, within 120 days after the written notice, the dissociated partner commences an action to determine the buyout price, any offsets under subdivision (c), or other terms of the obligation to purchase.
(h) A partner who wrongfully dissociates before the expiration of a definite term or the completion of a particular undertaking is not entitled to payment of any portion of the buyout price until the expiration of the term or completion of the undertaking, unless the partner establishes to the satisfaction of the court that earlier payment will not cause undue hardship to the business of the partnership. A deferred payment shall be adequately secured and bear interest.
(i) A dissociated partner may maintain an action against the partnership, pursuant to subparagraph (B) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (b) of Section 16405, to determine the buyout price of that partner’s interest, any offsets under subdivision (c), or other terms of the obligation to purchase. The action shall be commenced within 120 days after the partnership has tendered payment or an offer to pay or within one year after written demand for payment if no payment or offer to pay is tendered. The court shall determine the buyout price of the dissociated partner’s interest, any offset due under subdivision (c), and accrued interest, and enter judgment for any additional payment or refund. If deferred payment is authorized under subdivision (h), the court shall also determine the security for payment and other terms of the obligation to purchase. The court may assess reasonable attorney’s fees and the fees and expenses of appraisers or other experts for a party to the action, in amounts the court finds equitable, against a party that the court finds acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith. The finding may be based on the partnership’s failure to tender payment or an offer to pay or to comply with subdivision (g).

  (a) A dissociated partner or the partnership may file a statement of dissociation stating the name of the partnership as filed with the Secretary of State, any identification number issued by the Secretary of State, and that the partner is dissociated from the partnership.

(c) For the purposes of paragraph (3) of subdivision (a) of Section 16702 and paragraph (3) of subdivision (b) of Section 16703, a person not a partner is deemed to have notice of the dissociation 90 days after the statement of dissociation is filed.

(c) Recording of a certificate of conversion, a certificate of limited partnership, articles of organization, articles or certificate of incorporation, or other certificate evidencing the creation of another business entity by conversion, containing a statement of conversion, in accordance with Section 16902 shall create, in favor of bona fide purchasers or encumbrancers for value, a conclusive presumption that the conversion was validly completed.

  (a) Each partnership and other business entity which desires to merge shall approve an agreement of merger. The agreement of merger shall be approved by the number or percentage of partners specified for merger in the partnership agreement of the constituent partnership.

(e) An agreement of merger approved in accordance with subdivision (a) may (1) effect any amendment to the partnership agreement of any domestic constituent partnership or (2) effect the adoption of a new partnership agreement for a domestic constituent partnership if it is the surviving partnership in the merger. Any amendment to a partnership agreement or adoption of a new partnership agreement made pursuant to the foregoing sentence shall be effective at the effective time or date of the merger.
(f) The surviving partnership or surviving other business entity shall keep the agreement of merger at the principal place of business of the surviving entity if the surviving entity is a partnership or a foreign other business entity, at the office referred to in Section 1500 if the surviving entity is a domestic corporation, at 						the office referred to in subdivision (a) of Section 15901.14 if the surviving entity is a domestic limited partnership or at the office referred to in Section 17701.13 if the surviving entity is a domestic limited liability company and, upon the request of a partner of a constituent partnership or a holder of interests or other securities of a constituent other business entity, the authorized person on behalf of the partnership or the surviving other business entity shall promptly deliver to the partner or the holder of interests or other securities, at the expense of the surviving partnership or 						surviving other business entity, a copy of the agreement of merger. A waiver by a partner or holder of interests or other securities of the rights provided in this subdivision shall be unenforceable.

(2) All rights of creditors and all liens upon the property of each of the constituent partnerships and constituent other business entities shall be preserved unimpaired and may be enforced against the surviving partnership or the surviving other business entity to the same extent as if the debt, liability, or duty that gave rise to that lien had been incurred or contracted by it, provided that those liens upon the property of a disappearing partnership or disappearing other business entity shall be limited to the property affected thereby immediately before the time the merger is effective.
(3) Any action or proceeding pending by or against any disappearing partnership or disappearing other business entity may be prosecuted to judgment, which shall bind the surviving partnership or surviving other business entity, or the 						surviving partnership or surviving other business entity may be proceeded against or be substituted in the disappearing partnership’s or the disappearing other business entity’s place.
(b) (1) Unless a certificate of merger has been filed to effect the merger, the surviving foreign entity shall promptly notify the Secretary of State of the mailing address of its agent for service of process and its principal office, and of any change of address. To enforce an obligation of a partnership that has merged with a foreign partnership or foreign other business entity, the Secretary of State shall only be the agent for service of process in an action or proceeding against the surviving foreign partnership or foreign other business entity, if the agent designated for the service of process for that entity is a natural person and 						cannot be located with due diligence or if the agent is a corporation and no person to whom delivery may be made can be located with due diligence, or if no agent has been designated and if no one of the officers, partners, managers, members, or agents of the entity can be located after diligent search, and it is so shown by affidavit to the satisfaction of the court.

A partner that desires to dissociate from a disappearing partnership shall send written notice of that dissociation within 30 days after the date of the notice of the approval of the merger. The disappearing partnership shall cause the partner’s interest in the entity to be purchased under Section 16701. The surviving entity is bound under Section 16702 by an act of a general partner dissociated under this subdivision, and the partner is liable under Section 16703 for transactions entered into by the surviving entity after the merger takes effect.

(1) The name of the partnership.
(2) The street address of its principal office.
(3) The mailing address of its principal office, if different from the street address.

(c) The Secretary of State shall register as a registered limited liability partnership any partnership that submits a completed registration with the required 						fee.
(d) The Secretary of State may cancel the filing of the registration if a check or other remittance accepted in payment of the filing fee is not paid upon presentation. Within 90 days of receiving written notification that the item presented for payment has not been honored for payment, the Secretary of State shall give a first written notice of the applicability of this section to the agent for service of process or to the person submitting the instrument. Thereafter, if the amount has not been paid by cashier’s check or equivalent, the Secretary of State shall give a second written notice of cancellation and the cancellation shall thereupon be effective. The second notice shall be given 20 days or more after the first 						notice.
(e) A partnership becomes a registered limited liability partnership at the time of the filing of the initial registration with the Secretary of State or at any later date or time specified in the registration and the payment of the fee required by subdivision (b). A partnership continues as a registered limited liability partnership until a notice that it is no longer a registered limited liability partnership has been filed pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 16954 or, if applicable, until it has been dissolved and finally wound up. The status of a partnership as a registered limited liability partnership and the liability of a partner of the registered limited liability partnership shall not be adversely affected by errors or subsequent changes in the information stated in a registration under subdivision (a) or 						an amended registration or notice under Section 16954.
(f) The fact that a registration or amended registration pursuant to this section is on file with the Secretary of State is notice that the partnership is a registered limited liability partnership and of those other facts contained therein that are required to be set forth in the registration or amended registration.
(g) The Secretary of State shall provide a form for a registration under subdivision (a), which shall include the form for confirming compliance with the optional security requirement pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 16956. The Secretary of State shall include with instructional materials provided in conjunction with the form for a registration under subdivision (a) a notice that filing the registration 						will obligate the limited liability partnership to pay an annual tax for that taxable year to the Franchise Tax Board pursuant to Section 17948 of the Revenue and Taxation Code. That notice shall be updated annually to specify the dollar amount of the tax.
(h) A limited liability partnership providing professional limited liability partnership services in this state shall comply with all statutory and administrative registration or filing requirements of the state board, commission, or other agency that prescribes the rules and regulations governing the particular profession in which the partnership proposes to engage, pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Business and Professions Code relating to that profession. The state board, commission, or other agency shall not disclose, unless compelled by a subpoena or other order of a 						court of competent jurisdiction, any information it receives in the course of evaluating the compliance of a limited liability partnership with applicable statutory and administrative registration or filing requirements, provided that nothing in this section shall be 						construed to prevent a state board, commission, or other agency from disclosing the manner in which the limited liability partnership has complied with the requirements of Section 16956, or the compliance or noncompliance by the limited liability partnership with any other requirements of the state board, commission, or other agency.
(i) An agent designated for service of process may deliver to the Secretary of State, on a form prescribed by the Secretary of State for filing, a signed and acknowledged written statement of resignation as an agent for service of process containing the name of the limited liability partnership and the Secretary of State’s file number of the limited liability partnership, the name of the resigning agent for service of process, and a statement that the agent is resigning. On filing of the 						statement of resignation, the authority of the agent to act in that capacity shall cease and the Secretary of State shall mail or otherwise provide written notice of the filing of the statement of resignation to the limited liability partnership at its principal office.

(k) If an individual who has been designated agent for service of process dies, resigns, or no longer resides in the state or if the corporate agent for that purpose 						resigns, dissolves, withdraws from the state, forfeits its right to transact intrastate business, has its corporate rights, powers, and privileges suspended, or ceases to exist, the limited liability partnership shall promptly file an 						amended registration as a limited liability partnership designating a new agent.
(l) The Secretary of State may destroy or otherwise dispose of any statement of resignation filed pursuant to this section after a new registration is filed pursuant to this section replacing the agent for service of process that has resigned.

(b) If a registered limited liability partnership ceases to be a registered limited liability partnership, it shall file with the Secretary of State a notice, executed by one or more partners authorized to 						execute the notice, that it is no longer a registered limited liability partnership.

  (a) A domestic partnership, other than a limited partnership, may convert to a registered limited liability partnership by the vote of the partners possessing a majority of the interests of its partners in the current profits of the partnership or by a different vote as may be required in its partnership agreement.

(1) All property, real and personal, tangible and intangible, of the converting partnership remains vested in the converted registered limited liability partnership.

16956.
  (a) At the time of registration pursuant to Section 16953, in the case of a registered limited liability partnership, and Section 16959, in the case of a foreign limited liability partnership, and at all times during which those partnerships shall transact intrastate business, every registered limited liability partnership and foreign limited liability partnership, as the case may be, shall be required to provide security for claims against it as follows:
(1) For claims based upon acts, errors, or omissions arising out of the practice of public accountancy, a registered limited liability partnership or foreign limited liability partnership providing accountancy services shall comply with one, or pursuant to subdivision (b) some combination, of the following:
(A) Maintaining a policy or policies of insurance against liability imposed on or against it by law for damages arising out of claims; however, the total aggregate limit of liability under the policy or policies of insurance for partnerships with five or fewer licensed persons shall not be less than one million dollars ($1,000,000), and for partnerships with more than five licensees rendering professional services on behalf of the partnership, an additional one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) of insurance shall be obtained for each additional licensee; however, the maximum amount of insurance is not required to exceed five million dollars ($5,000,000) in any one designated period, less amounts paid in defending, settling, or discharging claims as set forth in this subparagraph. The policy or policies may be issued on a claims-made or occurrence basis, and shall cover: (i) in the case of a claims-made policy, claims initially asserted in the 				 designated period, and (ii) in the case of an occurrence policy, occurrences during the designated period. For purposes of this subparagraph, “designated period” means a policy year or any other period designated in the policy that is not greater than 12 months. The impairment or exhaustion of the aggregate limit of liability by amounts paid under the policy in connection with the settlement, discharge, or defense of claims applicable to a designated period shall not require the partnership to acquire additional insurance coverage for that designated period. The policy or policies of insurance may be in a form reasonably available in the commercial insurance market and may be subject to those terms, conditions, exclusions, and endorsements that are typically contained in those policies. A policy or policies of insurance maintained pursuant to this subparagraph may be subject to a deductible or self-insured retention.
Upon the dissolution and winding up of the 				 partnership, the partnership shall, with respect to any insurance policy or policies then maintained pursuant to this subparagraph, maintain or obtain an extended reporting period endorsement or equivalent provision in the maximum total aggregate limit of liability required to comply with this subparagraph for a minimum of three years if reasonably available from the insurer.
(B) Maintaining in trust or bank escrow, cash, bank certificates of deposit, United States Treasury obligations, bank letters of credit, or bonds of insurance or surety companies as security for payment of liabilities imposed by law for damages arising out of all claims; however, the maximum amount of security for partnerships with five or fewer licensed persons shall not be less than one million dollars ($1,000,000), and for partnerships with more than five licensees rendering professional services on behalf of the partnership, an additional one hundred thousand dollars 				 ($100,000) of security shall be obtained for each additional licensee; however, the maximum amount of security is not required to exceed five million dollars ($5,000,000). The partnership remains in compliance with this section during a calendar year notwithstanding amounts paid during that calendar year from the accounts, funds, Treasury obligations, letters of credit, or bonds in defending, settling, or discharging claims of the type described in this paragraph, provided that the amount of those accounts, funds, Treasury obligations, letters of credit, or bonds was at least the amount specified in the preceding sentence as of the first business day of that calendar year. Notwithstanding the pendency of other claims against the partnership, a registered limited liability partnership or foreign limited liability partnership shall be deemed to be in compliance with this subparagraph as to a claim if within 30 days after the time that a claim is initially asserted through service of a summons, complaint, or 				 comparable pleading in a judicial or administrative proceeding, the partnership has provided the required amount of security by designating and segregating funds in compliance with the requirements of this subparagraph.
(C) Unless the partnership has satisfied subparagraph (D), each partner of a registered limited liability partnership or foreign limited liability partnership providing accountancy services, by virtue of that person’s status as a partner, thereby automatically guarantees payment of the difference between the maximum amount of security required for the partnership by this paragraph and the security otherwise provided in accordance with subparagraphs (A) and (B), provided that the aggregate amount paid by all partners under these guarantees shall not exceed the difference. Neither withdrawal by a partner nor the dissolution and winding up of the partnership shall affect the rights or obligations of a partner arising prior to 				 withdrawal or dissolution and winding up, and the guarantee provided for in this subparagraph shall apply only to conduct that occurred prior to the withdrawal or dissolution and winding up. Nothing contained in this subparagraph shall affect or impair the rights or obligations of the partners among themselves, or the partnership, including, but not limited to, rights of contribution, subrogation, or indemnification.
(D) Confirming, pursuant to the procedure in subdivision (c), that, as of the most recently completed fiscal year of the partnership, it had a net worth equal to or exceeding ten million dollars ($10,000,000).
(2) For claims based upon acts, errors, or omissions arising out of the practice of law, a registered limited liability partnership or foreign limited liability partnership providing legal services shall comply with one, or pursuant to subdivision (b) some 				 combination, of the following:
(A) Each registered limited liability partnership or foreign limited liability partnership providing legal services shall maintain a policy or policies of insurance against liability imposed on or against it by law for damages arising out of claims; however, the total aggregate limit of liability under the policy or policies of insurance for partnerships with five or fewer licensed persons shall not be less than one million dollars ($1,000,000), and for partnerships with more than five licensees rendering professional services on behalf of the partnership, an additional one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) of insurance shall be obtained for each additional licensee; however, the maximum amount of insurance is not required to exceed seven million five hundred thousand dollars ($7,500,000) in any one designated period, less amounts paid in defending, settling, or discharging claims as set forth in this 				 subparagraph. The policy or policies may be issued on a claims-made or occurrence basis, and shall cover (i) in the case of a claims-made policy, claims initially asserted in the designated period, and (ii) in the case of an occurrence policy, occurrences during the designated period. For purposes of this subparagraph, “designated period” means a policy year or any other period designated in the policy that is not greater than 12 months. The impairment or exhaustion of the aggregate limit of liability by amounts paid under the policy in connection with the settlement, discharge, or defense of claims applicable to a designated period shall not require the partnership to acquire additional insurance coverage for that designated period. The policy or policies of insurance may be in a form reasonably available in the commercial insurance market and may be subject to those terms, conditions, exclusions, and endorsements that are typically contained in those policies. A policy or policies of insurance maintained 				 pursuant to this subparagraph may be subject to a deductible or self-insured retention.
Upon the dissolution and winding up of the partnership, the partnership shall, with respect to any insurance policy or policies then maintained pursuant to this subparagraph, maintain or obtain an extended reporting period endorsement or equivalent provision in the maximum total aggregate limit of liability required to comply with this subparagraph for a minimum of three years if reasonably available from the insurer.
(B) Each registered limited liability partnership or foreign limited liability partnership providing legal services shall maintain in trust or bank escrow, cash, bank certificates of deposit, United States Treasury obligations, bank letters of credit, or bonds of insurance or surety companies as security for payment of liabilities imposed by law for damages arising out of all claims; however, the 				 maximum amount of security for partnerships with five or fewer licensed persons shall not be less than one million dollars ($1,000,000), and for partnerships with more than five licensees rendering professional services on behalf of the partnership, an additional one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) of security shall be obtained for each additional licensee; however, the maximum amount of security is not required to exceed seven million five hundred thousand dollars ($7,500,000). The partnership remains in compliance with this section during a calendar year notwithstanding amounts paid during that calendar year from the accounts, funds, Treasury obligations, letters of credit, or bonds in defending, settling, or discharging claims of the type described in this paragraph, provided that the amount of those accounts, funds, Treasury obligations, letters of credit, or bonds was at least the amount specified in the preceding sentence as of the first business day of that calendar year. Notwithstanding the 				 pendency of other claims against the partnership, a registered limited liability partnership or foreign limited liability partnership shall be deemed to be in compliance with this subparagraph as to a claim if within 30 days after the time that a claim is initially asserted through service of a summons, complaint, or comparable pleading in a judicial or administrative proceeding, the partnership has provided the required amount of security by designating and segregating funds in compliance with the requirement of this subparagraph.
(C) Unless the partnership has satisfied the requirements of subparagraph (D), each partner of a registered limited liability partnership or foreign limited liability partnership providing legal services, by virtue of that person’s status as a partner, thereby automatically guarantees payment of the difference between the maximum amount of security required for the partnership by this paragraph and the security 				 otherwise provided in accordance with the provisions of subparagraphs (A) and (B), provided that the aggregate amount paid by all partners under these guarantees shall not exceed the difference. Neither withdrawal by a partner nor the dissolution and winding up of the partnership shall affect the rights or obligations of a partner arising prior to withdrawal or dissolution and winding up, and the guarantee provided for in this subparagraph shall apply only to conduct that occurred prior to the withdrawal or dissolution and winding up. Nothing contained in this subparagraph shall affect or impair the rights or obligations of the partners among themselves, or the partnership, including, but not limited to, rights of contribution, subrogation, or indemnification.
(D) Confirming, pursuant to the procedure in subdivision (c), that, as of the most recently completed fiscal year of the partnership, it had a net worth equal to or exceeding fifteen 				 million dollars ($15,000,000).
(3) For claims based upon acts, errors, or omissions arising out of the practice of architecture, a registered limited liability partnership or foreign limited liability partnership providing architectural services shall comply with one, or pursuant to subdivision (b) some combination, of the following:
(A) Maintaining a policy or policies of insurance against liability imposed on or against it by law for damages arising out of claims; however, the total aggregate limit of liability under the policy or policies of insurance for partnerships with five or fewer licensees rendering professional services on behalf of the partnership shall not be less than one million dollars ($1,000,000), and for partnerships with more than five licensees rendering professional services on behalf of the partnership, an additional one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) 				 of liability coverage shall be obtained for each additional licensee; however, the total aggregate limit of liability under the policy or policies of insurance is not required to exceed five million dollars ($5,000,000). The policy or policies may be issued on a claims-made or occurrence basis, and shall cover: (i) in the case of a claims-made policy, claims initially asserted in the designated period, and (ii) in the case of an occurrence policy, occurrences during the designated period. For purposes of this subparagraph, “designated period” means a policy year or any other period designated in the policy that is not greater than 12 months. The impairment or exhaustion of the aggregate limit of liability by amounts paid under the policy in connection with the settlement, discharge, or defense of claims applicable to a designated period shall not require the partnership to acquire additional insurance coverage for that designated period. The policy or policies of insurance may be in a form reasonably 				 available in the commercial insurance market and may be subject to those terms, conditions, exclusions, and endorsements that are typically contained in those policies. A policy or policies of insurance maintained pursuant to this subparagraph may be subject to a deductible or self-insured retention.
Upon the dissolution and winding up of the partnership, the partnership shall, with respect to any insurance policy or policies then maintained pursuant to this subparagraph, maintain or obtain an extended reporting period endorsement or equivalent provision in the maximum total aggregate limit of liability required to comply with this subparagraph for a minimum of three years if reasonably available from the insurer.
(B) Maintaining in trust or bank escrow, cash, bank certificates of deposit, United States Treasury obligations, bank letters of credit, or bonds of insurance or surety companies as security 				 for payment of liabilities imposed by law for damages arising out of all claims; however, the maximum amount of security for partnerships with five or fewer licensees rendering professional services on behalf of the partnership shall not be less than one million dollars ($1,000,000), and for partnerships with more than five licensees rendering professional services on behalf of the partnership, an additional one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) of security shall be obtained for each additional licensee; however, the maximum amount of security is not required to exceed five million dollars ($5,000,000).

(C) Unless the partnership has satisfied subparagraph (D), each partner of a registered limited liability partnership or foreign limited liability partnership providing architectural services, by virtue of that person’s status as a partner, thereby automatically guarantees payment of the difference 				 between the maximum amount of security required for the partnership by this paragraph and the security otherwise provided in accordance with subparagraphs (A) and (B), provided that the aggregate amount paid by all partners under these guarantees shall not exceed the difference.

16956.
  (a) At the time of registration pursuant to Section 16953, in the case of a registered limited liability partnership, and Section 16959, in the case of a foreign limited liability partnership, and at all times during which those partnerships shall transact intrastate business, every registered limited liability partnership and foreign limited liability partnership, as the case may be, shall be required to provide security for claims against it as follows:
(1) For claims based upon acts, errors, or omissions arising out of the practice of public accountancy, a registered limited liability partnership or foreign limited liability partnership providing accountancy services shall comply with one, or pursuant to subdivision (b) some combination, of the following:
(A) Maintaining a policy or policies of insurance against liability imposed on or against it by law for damages arising out of claims; however, the total aggregate limit of liability under the policy or policies of insurance for partnerships with five or fewer licensed persons shall not be less than one million dollars ($1,000,000), and for partnerships with more than five licensees rendering professional services on behalf of the partnership, an additional one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) of insurance shall be obtained for each additional licensee; however, the maximum amount of insurance is not required to exceed five million dollars ($5,000,000) in any one designated period, less amounts paid in defending, settling, or discharging claims as set forth in this subparagraph. The policy or policies may be issued on a claims-made or occurrence basis, and shall cover: (i) in the case of a claims-made policy, claims initially asserted in the 				 designated period, and (ii) in the case of an occurrence policy, occurrences during the designated period. For purposes of this subparagraph, “designated period” means a policy year or any other period designated in the policy that is not greater than 12 months. The impairment or exhaustion of the aggregate limit of liability by amounts paid under the policy in connection with the settlement, discharge, or defense of claims applicable to a designated period shall not require the partnership to acquire additional insurance coverage for that designated period. The policy or policies of insurance may be in a form reasonably available in the commercial insurance market and may be subject to those terms, conditions, exclusions, and endorsements that are typically contained in those policies. A policy or policies of insurance maintained pursuant to this subparagraph may be subject to a deductible or self-insured retention.
Upon the dissolution and winding up of the 				 partnership, the partnership shall, with respect to any insurance policy or policies then maintained pursuant to this subparagraph, maintain or obtain an extended reporting period endorsement or equivalent provision in the maximum total aggregate limit of liability required to comply with this subparagraph for a minimum of three years if reasonably available from the insurer.
(B) Maintaining in trust or bank escrow, cash, bank certificates of deposit, United States Treasury obligations, bank letters of credit, or bonds of insurance or surety companies as security for payment of liabilities imposed by law for damages arising out of all claims; however, the maximum amount of security for partnerships with five or fewer licensed persons shall not be less than one million dollars ($1,000,000), and for partnerships with more than five licensees rendering professional services on behalf of the partnership, an additional one hundred thousand dollars 				 ($100,000) of security shall be obtained for each additional licensee; however, the maximum amount of security is not required to exceed five million dollars ($5,000,000). The partnership remains in compliance with this section during a calendar year notwithstanding amounts paid during that calendar year from the accounts, funds, Treasury obligations, letters of credit, or bonds in defending, settling, or discharging claims of the type described in this paragraph, provided that the amount of those accounts, funds, Treasury obligations, letters of credit, or bonds was at least the amount specified in the preceding sentence as of the first business day of that calendar year. Notwithstanding the pendency of other claims against the partnership, a registered limited liability partnership or foreign limited liability partnership shall be deemed to be in compliance with this subparagraph as to a claim if within 30 days after the time that a claim is initially asserted through service of a summons, complaint, or 				 comparable pleading in a judicial or administrative proceeding, the partnership has provided the required amount of security by designating and segregating funds in compliance with the requirements of this subparagraph.
(C) Unless the partnership has satisfied subparagraph (D), each partner of a registered limited liability partnership or foreign limited liability partnership providing accountancy services, by virtue of that person’s status as a partner, thereby automatically guarantees payment of the difference between the maximum amount of security required for the partnership by this paragraph and the security otherwise provided in accordance with subparagraphs (A) and (B), provided that the aggregate amount paid by all partners under these guarantees shall not exceed the difference. Neither withdrawal by a partner nor the dissolution and winding up of the partnership shall affect the rights or obligations of a partner arising prior to 				 withdrawal or dissolution and winding up, and the guarantee provided for in this subparagraph shall apply only to conduct that occurred prior to the withdrawal or dissolution and winding up. Nothing contained in this subparagraph shall affect or impair the rights or obligations of the partners among themselves, or the partnership, including, but not limited to, rights of contribution, subrogation, or indemnification.
(D) Confirming, pursuant to the procedure in subdivision (c), that, as of the most recently completed fiscal year of the partnership, it had a net worth equal to or exceeding ten million dollars ($10,000,000).
(2) For claims based upon acts, errors, or omissions arising out of the practice of law, a registered limited liability partnership or foreign limited liability partnership providing legal services shall comply with one, or pursuant to subdivision (b) some 				 combination, of the following:
(A) Each registered limited liability partnership or foreign limited liability partnership providing legal services shall maintain a policy or policies of insurance against liability imposed on or against it by law for damages arising out of claims; however, the total aggregate limit of liability under the policy or policies of insurance for partnerships with five or fewer licensed persons shall not be less than one million dollars ($1,000,000), and for partnerships with more than five licensees rendering professional services on behalf of the partnership, an additional one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) of insurance shall be obtained for each additional licensee; however, the maximum amount of insurance is not required to exceed seven million five hundred thousand dollars ($7,500,000) in any one designated period, less amounts paid in defending, settling, or discharging claims as set forth in this 				 subparagraph. The policy or policies may be issued on a claims-made or occurrence basis, and shall cover (i) in the case of a claims-made policy, claims initially asserted in the designated period, and (ii) in the case of an occurrence policy, occurrences during the designated period. For purposes of this subparagraph, “designated period” means a policy year or any other period designated in the policy that is not greater than 12 months. The impairment or exhaustion of the aggregate limit of liability by amounts paid under the policy in connection with the settlement, discharge, or defense of claims applicable to a designated period shall not require the partnership to acquire additional insurance coverage for that designated period. The policy or policies of insurance may be in a form reasonably available in the commercial insurance market and may be subject to those terms, conditions, exclusions, and endorsements that are typically contained in those policies. A policy or policies of insurance maintained 				 pursuant to this subparagraph may be subject to a deductible or self-insured retention.
Upon the dissolution and winding up of the partnership, the partnership shall, with respect to any insurance policy or policies then maintained pursuant to this subparagraph, maintain or obtain an extended reporting period endorsement or equivalent provision in the maximum total aggregate limit of liability required to comply with this subparagraph for a minimum of three years if reasonably available from the insurer.
(B) Each registered limited liability partnership or foreign limited liability partnership providing legal services shall maintain in trust or bank escrow, cash, bank certificates of deposit, United States Treasury obligations, bank letters of credit, or bonds of insurance or surety companies as security for payment of liabilities imposed by law for damages arising out of all claims; however, the 				 maximum amount of security for partnerships with five or fewer licensed persons shall not be less than one million dollars ($1,000,000), and for partnerships with more than five licensees rendering professional services on behalf of the partnership, an additional one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) of security shall be obtained for each additional licensee; however, the maximum amount of security is not required to exceed seven million five hundred thousand dollars ($7,500,000). The partnership remains in compliance with this section during a calendar year notwithstanding amounts paid during that calendar year from the accounts, funds, Treasury obligations, letters of credit, or bonds in defending, settling, or discharging claims of the type described in this paragraph, provided that the amount of those accounts, funds, Treasury obligations, letters of credit, or bonds was at least the amount specified in the preceding sentence as of the first business day of that calendar year. Notwithstanding the 				 pendency of other claims against the partnership, a registered limited liability partnership or foreign limited liability partnership shall be deemed to be in compliance with this subparagraph as to a claim if within 30 days after the time that a claim is initially asserted through service of a summons, complaint, or comparable pleading in a judicial or administrative proceeding, the partnership has provided the required amount of security by designating and segregating funds in compliance with the requirement of this subparagraph.
(C) Unless the partnership has satisfied the requirements of subparagraph (D), each partner of a registered limited liability partnership or foreign limited liability partnership providing legal services, by virtue of that person’s status as a partner, thereby automatically guarantees payment of the difference between the maximum amount of security required for the partnership by this paragraph and the security 				 otherwise provided in accordance with the provisions of subparagraphs (A) and (B), provided that the aggregate amount paid by all partners under these guarantees shall not exceed the difference. Neither withdrawal by a partner nor the dissolution and winding up of the partnership shall affect the rights or obligations of a partner arising prior to withdrawal or dissolution and winding up, and the guarantee provided for in this subparagraph shall apply only to conduct that occurred prior to the withdrawal or dissolution and winding up. Nothing contained in this subparagraph shall affect or impair the rights or obligations of the partners among themselves, or the partnership, including, but not limited to, rights of contribution, subrogation, or indemnification.
(D) Confirming, pursuant to the procedure in subdivision (c), that, as of the most recently completed fiscal year of the partnership, it had a net worth equal to or exceeding fifteen 				 million dollars ($15,000,000).
(b) For purposes of satisfying the security requirements of this section, a registered limited liability partnership or foreign limited liability partnership may aggregate the security provided by it pursuant to subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), and (D) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) or subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), and (D) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) as the case may be. Any registered limited liability partnership or foreign limited liability partnership intending to comply with the alternative security provisions set forth in subparagraph (D) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) or subparagraph (D) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) shall furnish the following information to the Secretary of State’s office, in the manner prescribed in, and accompanied by all information required by, the applicable section:

(m) Without excluding 						other activities that may not be considered to be transacting intrastate business, a foreign limited liability partnership shall not be considered to be transacting intrastate business merely because its subsidiary or affiliate transacts intrastate business, or merely because of its status as any one or more of the following:

17703.01.
  (a) Unless the articles of organization indicate the limited liability company is a manager-managed limited liability company, every member is an agent of the limited liability company for the purpose of its business or affairs, and the act of any member, including, but not limited to, the execution in the name of the limited liability company of any instrument, for the apparent purpose of carrying on in the usual way the business or affairs of the limited liability company of which that person is a member, binds the limited liability company in the particular matter, unless the member so acting has, in fact, no authority to act for the limited liability company in the particular matter and the person with whom the member 							 is dealing has actual knowledge of the fact that the member has no such authority.
(b) If the articles of organization indicate that the limited liability company is a manager-managed limited liability company, each of the following applies:
(1) No member acting solely in the capacity of a member is an agent of the limited liability company nor can any member bind or execute any instrument on behalf of the limited liability company.
(2) Every manager is an agent of the limited liability company for the purpose of its business or affairs, and the act of any manager, including, but not limited to, the execution in the name of the limited liability company of any instrument for apparently carrying on in the usual way 							 the business or affairs of the limited liability company of which the person is a manager, binds the limited liability company, unless the manager so acting has, in fact, no authority to act for the limited liability company in the particular matter and the person with whom the manager is dealing has actual knowledge of the fact that the manager has no such authority.
(c) No act of a manager or member in contravention of a restriction on authority shall bind the limited liability company to persons having actual knowledge of the restriction.
(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (c), any note, mortgage, evidence of indebtedness, contract, certificate, statement, conveyance, or other instrument in writing, and any assignment or endorsement thereof, executed or entered 							 into between any limited liability company and any other person, when signed by at least two managers, or by one manager in the case of a limited liability company whose articles of organization state that it is managed by only one manager, is not invalidated as to the limited 							 liability company by any lack of authority of the signing managers or manager in the absence of actual knowledge on the part of the other person that the signing managers or manager had no authority to execute the same.
(Added by Stats. 2012, Ch. 419, Sec. 20. (SB 323) Effective January 1, 2013. Operative January 1, 2014, by Sec. 32 of Ch. 419.)
17703.04.

(1) They are solely the debts, obligations, or other liabilities of the limited liability company to which the debts, obligations, or other liabilities relate.

(b) A member of a limited 							 liability company shall be subject to liability under the common law governing alter ego liability, and shall also be personally liable under a judgment of a court or for any debt, obligation, or liability of the limited liability company, whether that liability or obligation arises in contract, tort, or otherwise, under the same or similar circumstances and to the same extent as a shareholder of a corporation may be personally liable for any debt, obligation, or liability of the corporation; except that the failure to hold meetings of members or managers or the failure to observe formalities pertaining to the calling or conduct of meetings shall not be considered a factor tending to establish that a member or the members have alter ego or personal liability for any debt, obligation, or liability of the limited liability company where the articles of organization or operating agreement do not expressly 							 require the holding of meetings of members or managers.
(c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the liability of a member of a limited liability company to third parties for the member’s participation in tortious conduct, or pursuant to the terms of a written guarantee or other contractual obligation entered into by the member, other than an operating agreement.
(d) A limited liability company or foreign limited liability company shall carry insurance or provide an undertaking to the same extent and in the same amount as is required by any law, rule, or regulation of this state that would be applicable to the limited liability company or foreign limited liability company were it a corporation organized and existing or duly qualified for the transaction of intrastate 							 business under the General Corporation Law.
(e) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), a member of a limited liability company may agree to be obligated personally for any or all of the debts, obligations, and liabilities of the limited liability company as long as the agreement to be so obligated is set forth in the articles of organization or in a written operating agreement that specifically references this subdivision.

17704.01.
  (a) If a limited liability company is to have only one member upon formation, the person becomes a member as agreed by that person and the organizer of the limited liability company. That person and the organizer may be, but need not be, different persons. If different, the organizer acts on behalf of the initial member.
(b) If a limited liability company is to have more than one member upon formation, those persons become members as agreed by the persons before the formation of the limited liability company. The organizer acts on behalf of the persons in forming the limited liability company and may be, but need not be, one of the persons.
(c) After 				 formation of a limited liability company, a person becomes a member as follows:
(1) As provided in the operating agreement.
(2) As the result of a transaction effective under Article 10 (commencing with Section 17710.01).

17704.02.
  A contribution may consist of tangible or intangible property or other benefit to a limited liability company, including money, services performed, promissory notes, other agreements to contribute money or property, and contracts for services to be performed.
(Added by Stats. 2012, Ch. 419, Sec. 20. (SB 323) Effective January 1, 2013. Operative January 1, 2014, by Sec. 32 of Ch. 419.)
17704.03.
  (a) A person’s obligation to make a contribution to a limited liability company is not excused by the person’s death, disability, or other inability to perform personally. If a person does not make a required contribution, the person or the person’s estate is obligated to contribute money equal to the value of the part of the contribution that has not been made, at the option of the limited liability company.
(b) The obligation of a member to make a contribution to a limited liability company may be compromised only by consent of all the members. A conditional obligation of a member to make a contribution to a limited liability company shall not be enforced unless the conditions of the obligation have been satisfied or waived as to or by that member. Conditional 				 obligations include contributions payable upon a discretionary call of a limited liability company before the time the call occurs.
(c) A creditor of a limited liability company that extends credit or otherwise acts in reliance on an obligation described in subdivision (a) may enforce the obligation.

(Amended by Stats. 2015, Ch. 44, Sec. 23. (SB 161) Effective January 1, 2016.)
17704.04.
  (a) Any distributions made by a limited liability company before its dissolution and winding up shall be among the members in accordance with the operating agreement. If the operating agreement does not otherwise provide, distributions shall be on the basis of the value, as stated in the required records when the limited liability company decides to make the distribution, of the contributions the limited liability company has received from each member, except to the extent necessary to comply with any transfer effective under Section 17705.02 and any charging order in effect under Section 17705.03.
(b) A person has a right to a distribution before the dissolution and winding up of a limited liability company only if the 				 limited liability company decides to make an interim distribution. Unless the articles of organization or written operating agreement provides otherwise, a person’s dissociation does not entitle the person to a distribution, and, beginning on the date of dissociation, the dissociated person shall have only the right of a transferee of a transferable interest with respect to that person’s interest in the limited liability company, and then only with respect to distributions, if any, to which a transferee is entitled under the operating agreement. If the dissociation is in violation of the operating agreement, the limited liability company shall have the right to offset any damages for the breach of the operating agreement from the amounts, if any, otherwise distributable to the dissociated person with respect to that person’s interest in the limited liability company.
(c) A person does not have a right to demand or receive a distribution from a 				 limited liability company in any form other than money. A limited liability company may distribute an asset in kind if each part of the asset is fungible with each other part and each person receives a percentage of the asset equal in value to the person’s share of distributions.
(d) If a member or transferee becomes entitled to receive a distribution, the member or transferee has the status of, and is entitled to all remedies available to, a creditor of the limited liability company with respect to the distribution.
(e) The profits and losses of a limited liability company shall be allocated among the members, and among classes of members, in the manner provided in the operating agreement. If the operating agreement does not otherwise provide, profits and losses shall be allocated in proportion to the value, as stated in the required records, of the contributions the limited 				 liability company has received from each member.
(Amended by Stats. 2015, Ch. 775, Sec. 6. (AB 506) Effective January 1, 2016.)
17704.05.
  (a) A limited liability company shall not make a distribution if after the distribution either of the following applies:
(1) The limited liability company would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the ordinary course of the limited liability company’s activities.
(2) The limited liability company’s total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed, if the limited liability company were to be dissolved, wound up, and terminated at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution, winding up, and termination 							 of members whose preferential rights are superior to those of persons receiving the distribution.
(b) A limited liability company may base a determination that a distribution is not prohibited under subdivision (a) on financial statements prepared on the basis of accounting practices and principles that are reasonable in the circumstances or on a fair valuation or other method that is reasonable under the circumstances.
(c) Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (f), the effect of a distribution under subdivision (a) is measured as follows:
(1) In the case of a distribution by purchase, redemption, or other acquisition of a transferable interest in the limited liability company, as of the date money or other 							 property is transferred or debt incurred by the limited liability company.
(2) In all other cases, as of the date the distribution is authorized, if the payment occurs within 120 days after that date, or the payment is made, if the payment occurs more than 120 days after the distribution is authorized.
(d) A limited liability company’s indebtedness to a member incurred by reason of a distribution made in accordance with this section is at parity with the limited liability company’s indebtedness to its general, unsecured creditors.
(e) A limited liability company’s indebtedness, including indebtedness issued in connection with or as part of a distribution, is not a liability for purposes of subdivision (a) if the terms of the indebtedness 							 provide that payment of principal and interest are made only to the extent that a distribution could be made to members under this section.
(f) If indebtedness is issued as a distribution, each payment of principal or interest on the indebtedness is treated as a distribution, the effect of which is measured on the date the payment is made.
(g) In subdivision (f) of Section 17701.02, “distribution” does not include amounts constituting reasonable compensation for present or past services or reasonable payments made in the ordinary course of business under a bona fide retirement plan or other benefits program.
(Added by Stats. 2012, Ch. 419, Sec. 20. (SB 323) Effective January 1, 2013. Operative January 1, 2014, by Sec. 32 of Ch. 419.)
17704.06.
  (a) Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (b), if a member of a member-managed limited liability company or manager of a manager-managed limited liability company consents to a distribution made in violation of Section 17704.05, the member or manager is personally liable to the limited liability company for the amount of the distribution that exceeds the amount that could have been distributed without the violation of Section 17704.05.
(b) To the extent the operating agreement of a member-managed limited liability company expressly relieves a member of the authority and responsibility to consent to distributions and imposes that authority and 							 responsibility on one or more other members, the liability stated in subdivision (a) applies to the other members and not the member that the operating agreement relieves of authority and responsibility.
(c) A person that receives a distribution knowing that the distribution to that person was made in violation of Section 17704.05 is personally liable to the limited liability company but only to the extent that the distribution received by the person exceeded the amount that could have been properly paid under Section 17704.05.
(d) A person against which an action is commenced because the person is liable under subdivision (a) may do all of the following:
(1) Implead any other person that is subject to liability 							 under subdivision (a) and seek to compel contribution from the person.
(2) Implead any person that received a distribution in violation of subdivision (c) and seek to compel contribution from the person in the amount the person received in violation of subdivision (c).
(e) An action under this section is barred if not commenced within four years after the distribution.
(Added by Stats. 2012, Ch. 419, Sec. 20. (SB 323) Effective January 1, 2013. Operative January 1, 2014, by Sec. 32 of Ch. 419.)
17704.07.
  (a) A limited liability company is a member-managed limited liability company unless the articles of organization contain the statement required by paragraph (5) of subdivision (b) of Section 17702.01.
(b) In a member-managed limited liability company, the following rules apply:
(1) The management and conduct of the limited liability company are vested in the members.
(2) Except as provided in subdivision (r), each member has equal rights in the management and conduct of the limited liability company’s activities including equal voting rights.
(3) A difference arising among members as to a matter in the ordinary course of the activities of the limited liability company shall be decided by a majority of the members.
(4) Except as otherwise provided in Article 10 (commencing with Section 17710.01), an act outside the ordinary course of the activities of the limited liability company may be undertaken only with the consent of all members.
(5) The operating agreement may be amended only with the consent of all members.
(c) In a manager-managed limited liability company, the following rules apply:
(1) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this title, any matter relating to the activities of the limited liability company is decided 				 exclusively by the managers.
(2) Each manager has equal rights in the management and conduct of the activities of the limited liability company.
(3) A difference arising among managers as to a matter in the ordinary course of the activities of the limited liability company may be decided by a majority of the managers of the limited liability company.
(4) The consent of all members of the limited liability company is required to do any of the following:
(A) Sell, lease, exchange, or otherwise dispose of all, or substantially all, of the limited liability company’s property, with or without the goodwill, outside the ordinary course of the limited liability company’s activities.
(B) Except as 				 otherwise provided in Article 10 (commencing with Section 17710.01), any other act outside the ordinary course of the limited liability company’s activities.
(5) A manager may be chosen at any time by the consent of a majority of the members and remains a manager until a successor has been chosen, unless the manager at an earlier time resigns, is removed, or dies, or, in the case of a manager that is not an individual, terminates. A manager may be removed at any time by the consent of a majority of the members without cause, subject to the rights, if any, of the manager under any service contract with the limited liability company.
(6) A person need not be a member to be a manager, but the dissociation of a member that is also a manager removes the person as a manager. If a person that is both a manager and a member ceases to be a manager, that cessation does not by itself 				 dissociate the person as a member.
(7) A person’s ceasing to be a manager does not discharge any debt, obligation, or other liability to the limited liability company or members which the person incurred while a manager.
(d) Except for such orders as may be made by a court of competent jurisdiction over a dissolution under Section 17707.03, the dissolution of a limited liability company does not affect the applicability of this section. However, a person that wrongfully causes dissolution of the limited liability company loses the right to participate in management as a member and a manager.
(e) This title does not entitle a member to remuneration for services performed for a member-managed limited liability company, except for reasonable compensation for services rendered in winding up the activities of a limited 				 liability company.
(f) Meetings of members may be held at any place, by electronic video screen communication or by electronic transmission by and to the limited liability company pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) of subdivision (i) of Section 17701.02, either within or without this state, selected by the person or persons calling the meeting or as may be stated in or fixed in accordance with the articles of organization or a written operating agreement. If no other place is stated or so fixed, all meetings shall be held at the principal office of the limited liability company. Unless prohibited by the articles of organization of the limited liability company, if authorized by the operating agreement, members not physically present in person or by proxy at a meeting of members may, by electronic transmission by and to the limited liability company pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) of subdivision (i) of Section 17701.02 or by electronic video 				 screen communication, participate in a meeting of members, be deemed present in person or by proxy, and vote at a meeting of members whether that meeting is to be held at a designated place or in whole or in part by means of electronic transmission by and to the limited liability company or by electronic video screen communication, in accordance with subdivision (l).
(g) A meeting of the members may be called by any manager or by any member or members representing more than 10 percent of the interests in current profits of members for the purpose of addressing any matters on which the members may vote.
(h) (1) Whenever members are required or permitted to take any action at a meeting, a written notice of the meeting shall be given not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting to each member entitled to vote at the meeting. The 				 notice shall state the place, date, and hour of the meeting, the means of electronic transmission by and to the limited liability company or electronic video screen communication, if any, and the general nature of the business to be transacted. No other business may be transacted at that meeting.
(2) Any report or any notice of a members’ meeting shall be given personally, by electronic transmission by the limited liability company, or by mail or other means of written communication, addressed to the member at the address of the member appearing on the books of the limited liability company or given by the member to the limited liability company for the purpose of notice, or, if no address appears or is given, at the place where the principal office of the limited liability company is located or by publication at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the principal office is located. The notice or report shall 				 be deemed to have been given at the time when delivered personally, delivered by electronic transmission by the limited liability company, deposited in the mail, or sent by other means of written communication. An affidavit of mailing or delivered by electronic transmission by the limited liability company of any notice or report in accordance with this article, executed by a manager, shall be prima facie evidence of the giving of the notice or report.
(3) If any notice or report addressed to the member at the address of the member appearing on the books of the limited liability company is returned to the limited liability company by the United States Postal Service marked to indicate that the United States Postal Service is unable to deliver the notice or report to the member at the address, all future notices or reports shall be deemed to have been duly given without further mailing if they are available for the member at the principal office 				 of the limited liability company for a period of one year from the date of the giving of the notice or report to all other members.
(4) Notice given by electronic transmission by the limited liability company under this subdivision shall be valid only if it complies with paragraph (1) of subdivision (i) of Section 17701.02.
Notwithstanding this condition, notice shall not be given by electronic transmission by the limited liability company under this subdivision after either of the following has occurred:
(A) The limited liability company is unable to deliver two consecutive notices to the member by that means.
(B) The inability to so deliver the notices to the member becomes known to the secretary, any assistant secretary, the transfer agent, or any other person responsible 				 for the giving of the notice.
(5) Upon written request to a manager by any person entitled to call a meeting of members, the manager shall immediately cause notice to be given to the members entitled to vote that a meeting will be held at a time requested by the person calling the meeting, not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days after the receipt of the request. If the notice is not given within 20 days after receipt of the request, the person entitled to call the meeting may give the notice or, upon the application of that person, the superior court of the county in which the principal office of the limited liability company is located, or if the principal office is not in this state, the county in which the limited liability company’s address in this state is located, shall summarily order the giving of the notice, after notice to the limited liability company affording it an opportunity to be heard. The procedure provided in subdivision 				 (c) of Section 305 shall apply to the application. The court may issue any order as may be appropriate, including, without limitation, an order designating the time and place of the meeting, the record date for determination of members entitled to vote, and the form of notice.
(i) When a members’ meeting is adjourned to another time or place, unless the articles of organization or a written operating agreement otherwise require and except as provided in this subdivision, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof or the means of electronic transmission by and to the limited liability company or electronic video screen communication, if any, are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting, the limited liability company may transact any business that may have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than 45 days, or if after the 				 adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each member of record entitled to vote at the meeting.
(j) The actions taken at any meeting of members, however called and noticed, and wherever held, have the same validity as if taken at a meeting duly held after regular call and notice, if a quorum is present either in person or by proxy, and if, either before or after the meeting, each of the members entitled to vote, not present in person or by proxy, provides a waiver of notice or consents to the holding of the meeting or approves the minutes of the meeting in writing. All waivers, consents, and approvals shall be filed with the limited liability company records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting after conversion to the form in which those records or minutes are kept. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of the meeting, except 				 when the person objects, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Attendance at a meeting is not a waiver of any right to object to the consideration of matters required by this title to be included in the notice but not so included, if the objection is expressly made at the meeting. Neither the business to be transacted nor the purpose of any meeting of members need be specified in any written waiver of notice, unless otherwise provided in the articles of organization or operating agreement, except as provided in subdivision (l).
(k) Members may participate in a meeting of the limited liability company through the use of conference telephones or electronic video screen communication, as long as all members participating in the meeting can hear one another, or by electronic transmission by and to the limited liability company pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) of 				 subdivision (i) of Section 17701.02. Participation in a meeting pursuant to this provision constitutes presence in person at that meeting.

(m) (1) A majority of the members represented in person or by proxy shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of members.
(2) The members present at a duly called or held meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the loss of a quorum, if any action taken after loss of a quorum, other than adjournment, is approved by the requisite percentage of interests of members 				 specified in this title or in the articles of organization or a written operating agreement.
(3) In the absence of a quorum, any meeting of members may be adjourned from time to time by the vote of a majority of the interests represented either in person or by proxy, but no other business may be transacted, except as provided in paragraph (2).
(n) (1) Any action that may be taken at any meeting of the members may be taken without a meeting if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, is signed and delivered to the limited liability company within 60 days of the record date for that action by members having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take that action at a meeting at which all members entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.
(2) Unless the consents of all members entitled to vote have been solicited in writing, (A) notice of any member approval of an amendment to the articles of organization or operating agreement, a dissolution of the limited liability company as provided in Section 17707.01, or a merger of the limited liability company as provided in Section 17710.10, without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given at least 10 days before the consummation of the action authorized by the approval, and (B) prompt notice shall be given of the taking of any other action approved by members without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent, to those members entitled to vote who have not consented in writing.
(3) Any member giving a written consent, or the member’s proxyholder, may revoke the consent personally or by proxy by a writing received by the limited liability company prior to the time that written consents of 				 members having the minimum number of votes that would be required to authorize the proposed action have been filed with the limited liability company, but may not do so thereafter. This revocation is effective upon its receipt at the office of the limited liability company required to be maintained pursuant to Section 17701.13.
(o) The use of proxies in connection with this section shall be governed in the same manner as in the case of corporations formed under the General Corporation Law, Division 1 (commencing with Section 100) of Title 1.
(p) In order that the limited liability company may determine the members of record entitled to notices of any meeting or to vote, or entitled to receive any distribution or to exercise any rights in respect of any other lawful action, a manager, or members representing more than 10 percent of the interests of members, may fix, in advance, a 				 record date, that is not more than 60 days nor less than 10 days prior to the date of the meeting and not more than 60 days prior to any other action. If no record date is fixed the following shall apply:
(1) The record date for determining members entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of members shall be at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is given or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held.
(2) The record date for determining members entitled to give consent to limited liability company action in writing without a meeting shall be the day on which the first written consent is given.
(3) The record date for determining members for any other purpose shall be at the close of business 				 on the day on which the managers adopt the resolution relating thereto, or the 60th day prior to the date of the other action, whichever is later.
(4) The determination of members of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of members shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting unless a manager or the members who called the meeting fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting, but the manager or the members who called the meeting shall fix a new record date if the meeting is adjourned for more than 45 days from the date set for the original meeting.
(q) A meeting of the members may be conducted, in whole or in part, by electronic transmission by and to the limited liability company or by electronic video screen communication if both of the following requirements are met:
(1) The limited liability 				 company implements reasonable measures to provide members, in person or by proxy, a reasonable opportunity to participate in the meeting and to vote on matters submitted to the members, including an opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of the meeting substantially concurrently with those proceedings.
(2) When any member votes or takes other action at the meeting by means of electronic transmission to the limited liability company or electronic video screen communication, a record of that vote or action shall be maintained by the limited liability company.
(r) The articles of organization or a written operating agreement may provide to all or certain identified members of a specified class or group of members the right to vote separately or with all or any class or group of members on any matter. Voting by members may be on a per capita, number, financial interest, class, 				 group, or any other basis. If no voting provision is contained in the articles of organization or written operating agreement, each of the following shall apply:
(1) The members of a limited liability company shall vote in proportion to their interests in current profits of the limited liability company or, in the case of a member who has assigned the member’s entire transferable interest in the limited liability company to a person who has not been admitted as a member, in proportion to the interest in current profits that the assigning member would have, had the assignment not been made.
(2) Any amendment to the articles of organization or operating agreement shall require the unanimous vote of all members.
(3) In all other matters in which a vote is required, except as otherwise provided in this section, a vote of 				 a majority of the members shall be sufficient.
(s) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the articles of organization or operating agreement, in no event shall the articles of organization be amended by a vote of less than a majority of the members.
(t) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the articles of organization or operating agreement, members shall have the right to vote on a dissolution of the limited liability company as provided in subdivision (b) of Section 17707.01, on a conversion to another business entity as provided in subdivision (b) of Section 17710.03, and on a merger of the limited liability company as provided in Section 17710.12.
(u) A written operating agreement may provide for the appointment of officers, including, but not limited to, a chairperson or a president, or 				 both a chairperson and a president, a secretary, a chief financial officer, and any other officers with the titles, powers, and duties as shall be specified in the articles of organization or operating agreement or as determined by the managers or members. An officer may, but does not need to, be a member or manager of the limited liability company, and any number of offices may be held by the same person.
(v) Officers, if any, shall be appointed in accordance with the written operating agreement or, if no such provision is made in the operating agreement, any officers shall be appointed by the managers and shall serve at the pleasure of the managers, subject to the rights, if any, of an officer under any contract of employment. Any officer may resign at any time upon written notice to the limited liability company without prejudice to the rights, if any, of the limited liability under any contract to which the officer is a party.
(w) Subject to the provisions of the articles of organization, any note, mortgage, evidence of indebtedness, contract, certificate, statement, conveyance, or other instrument in writing, and any assignment or endorsement thereof, executed or entered into between any limited liability company and any other person, when signed by the chairperson of the board, the president, or any vice president and any secretary, any assistant secretary, the chief financial officer, or any assistant treasurer of the limited liability company, is not invalidated as to the limited liability company by any lack of authority of the signing officers in the absence of actual knowledge on the part of the other person that the signing officers had no authority to execute the same.

17705.02.
  (a) With respect to a transfer, in whole or in part, of a transferable interest, all of the following apply:
(1) A transfer is permissible.
(2) A transfer does not by itself cause a member’s dissociation or a dissolution and winding up of the activities of a limited liability company.
(3) Subject to Section 17705.04, a transfer does not entitle the transferee to do any of the following:
(A) Vote or otherwise participate in the management or conduct of the activities of a limited liability company.
(B) Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (c) and Section 17704.10, have access to records or other information concerning the activities of a limited liability company.
(b) A transferee has the right to receive, in accordance with the transfer, distributions to which the transferor would otherwise be entitled; provided, however, that the pledge or granting of a security interest, lien, or other encumbrance in or against any or all of the transferable interest of a transferor shall not cause the transferor to cease to be a member or grant to the transferee or to anyone else the power to exercise any rights or powers of a member, including, without limitation, the right to receive distributions to which the member is entitled.
(c) In a dissolution and winding up of a limited liability company, a transferee is 				 entitled to an account of the limited liability company’s transactions only from the date of dissolution.
(d) A transferable interest may be evidenced by a certificate of the interest issued by the limited liability company in a record, and, subject to this article, the interest represented by the certificate may be transferred by a transfer of the certificate.
(e) A limited liability company need not give effect to a transferee’s rights under this section until the limited liability company has notice of the transfer.

17705.03.
  (a) On application by a judgment creditor of a member or transferee, a court may enter a charging order against the transferable interest of the judgment debtor for the unsatisfied amount of the judgment. A charging order constitutes a lien on a judgment debtor’s transferable interest and requires the limited liability company to pay over to the person to which the charging order was issued any distribution that would otherwise be paid to the judgment debtor.
(b) To the extent necessary to effectuate the collection of distributions pursuant to a charging order in effect under subdivision (a), the court may do any of the following:
(1) Appoint a receiver of the distributions subject to the charging order, with the power to make all inquiries the judgment debtor might have made.
(2) Make all other orders necessary to give effect to the charging order.
(3) Upon a showing that distributions under a charging order will not pay the judgment debt within a reasonable time, foreclose the lien and order the sale of the transferable interest. The purchaser at the foreclosure sale obtains only the transferable interest, does not thereby become a member, and is subject to Section 17705.02.
(c) At any time before foreclosure under paragraph (3) of subdivision (b), the member or transferee whose 							 transferable interest is subject to a charging order under subdivision (a) may extinguish the charging order by satisfying the judgment and filing a certified copy of the satisfaction with the court that issued the charging order.
(d) At any time before foreclosure under paragraph (3) of subdivision (b), a limited liability company or one or more members whose transferable interests are not subject to the charging order may pay to the judgment creditor the full amount due under the judgment and thereby succeed to the rights of the judgment creditor, including the charging order.
(e) This title does not deprive any member or transferee of the benefit of any exemption laws applicable to the member’s or transferee’s transferable interest.
(f) This section provides the exclusive remedy by which a person seeking to enforce a judgment against a member or transferee may, in the capacity of judgment creditor, satisfy the judgment from the judgment debtor’s transferable interest.
(Added by Stats. 2012, Ch. 419, Sec. 20. (SB 323) Effective January 1, 2013. Operative January 1, 2014, by Sec. 32 of Ch. 419.)
17705.04.

(4) The person is a limited liability company or partnership that has been dissolved and whose business is being wound up.
(e) On application by the limited liability company, the person is expelled as a member by judicial order because the person has done any of the following:

Any member aggrieved by the action of the court may appeal therefrom.
(4) If the purchasing parties desire to prevent the winding up and dissolution of the limited liability company, they shall pay to the moving parties the value of their membership interests ascertained and decreed within the time specified pursuant to this section, or, in the case of an appeal, as fixed on appeal. On receiving that payment or the tender of payment, the moving parties shall transfer their membership interests to the purchasing parties.

Service in this manner is deemed complete on the 10th day after delivery of the process to the Secretary of State.

17709.02.
  (a) No action shall be instituted or maintained in right of any domestic or foreign limited liability company by any member of the limited liability company unless both of the following conditions exist:
(1) The plaintiff alleges in the complaint that the plaintiff was a member, of record or beneficially, at the time of the transaction or any part of the transaction of which the plaintiff complains, or that the plaintiff’s interest later devolved upon the plaintiff by operation of law from a member who was a member at the time of the transaction or any part of the transaction complained of. Any member who does not meet these requirements may nevertheless be allowed in the 						discretion of the court to maintain the action on a preliminary showing to and determination by the court, by motion and after a hearing at which the court shall consider any evidence, by affidavit or testimony, as it deems material, of all of the following:
(A) There is a strong prima facie case in favor of the claim asserted on behalf of the limited liability company.
(B) No other similar action has been or is likely to be instituted.
(C) The plaintiff acquired the interest before there was disclosure to the public or to the plaintiff of the wrongdoing of which plaintiff complains.
(D) Unless the action can be maintained, the defendant may retain a gain 						derived from defendant’s willful breach of a fiduciary duty.

(2) The plaintiff alleges in the complaint with particularity the plaintiff’s efforts to secure from the managers the action the plaintiff desires or the reasons for not making that effort, and alleges further that the plaintiff has either informed the limited liability company or the managers in writing of the ultimate facts of each cause of action against each defendant or delivered to the limited liability company or the managers a true copy of the complaint that the plaintiff proposes to file.
(b) In any action 						referred to in subdivision (a), at any time within 30 days after service of summons upon the limited liability company or upon any defendant who is a manager of the limited liability company or held that position at the time of the acts complained of, the limited liability company or the defendant may move the court for an order, upon notice and hearing, requiring the plaintiff to furnish security as hereinafter provided. The motion shall be based upon one or both of the following grounds:
(1) That there is no reasonable possibility that the prosecution of the cause of action alleged in the complaint against the moving party will benefit the limited liability company or its members.
(2) That the moving party, if other than the limited liability company did not participate in the 						transaction complained of in any capacity. The court, on application of the limited liability company or any defendant, may, for good cause shown, extend the 30-day period for an additional period not exceeding 60 days.
(c) (1) At the hearing upon any motion pursuant to subdivision (b), the court shall consider evidence, written or oral, by witnesses or affidavit, as may be material to the ground upon which the motion is based, or to a determination of the probable reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, of the limited liability company and the moving party that will be incurred in the defense of the action.
(2) If the court determines, after hearing the evidence adduced by the parties, that the moving party has established a probability in 						support of any of the grounds upon which the motion is based, the court shall fix the nature and amount of security, not to exceed fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), to be furnished by the plaintiff for reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, that may be incurred by the moving party and the limited liability company in connection with the action. A ruling by the court on the motion shall not be a determination of any issue in the action or of the merits of the action. The amount of the security may thereafter be increased or decreased in the discretion of the court upon a showing that the security provided has or may become inadequate or is excessive, but the court shall not in any event increase the total amount of the security beyond fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) in the aggregate for all defendants. If the court, upon a motion, makes a determination that security shall be furnished by the plaintiff 						as to any one or more defendants, the action shall be dismissed as to that defendant or those defendants, unless the security required by the court has been furnished within any reasonable time as shall be fixed by the court. The limited liability company and the moving party shall have recourse to the security in the amount that the court determines upon the termination of the action.
(d) If the plaintiff, either before or after a motion is made pursuant to subdivision (b), or any order or determination pursuant to that motion, posts good and sufficient bond or bonds in the aggregate amount of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) to secure the reasonable expenses of the parties entitled to make the motion, the plaintiff shall be deemed to have complied with the requirements of this section and with any order for security made pursuant to this 						section. Any motion then pending shall be dismissed and no further or additional bond or other security shall be required.
(e) If a motion is filed pursuant to subdivision (b), no pleadings need be filed by the limited liability company or any other defendant and the prosecution of the action shall be stayed until 10 days after the motion has been disposed of.

(c) The demand shall state the number or amount of the member’s interest in the limited liability company and shall contain a statement of what the member claims to be the fair market value of that interest on the day before the announcement of the proposed reorganization.

(b) Two or more dissenting members may join as plaintiffs or be joined as defendants in any of those actions and two or more of those actions may be consolidated.
(c) On the trial of the action, the court shall determine the issues. If the status of the membership interest as a dissenting interest is in issue, the court shall first determine that issue.

(d) Any of those judgments shall 							 be payable forthwith, provided, however, that with respect to membership interests evidenced by transferable certificates of interest, only upon the endorsement and delivery to the limited liability company of those certificates representing the interests described in the judgment. Any party may appeal from the judgment.
(e) The costs of the action, including reasonable compensation for the appraisers, to be fixed by the court, shall be assessed or apportioned as the court considers equitable, but, if the appraisal exceeds the price offered by the limited liability company, the limited liability company shall pay the costs, including, in the discretion of the court, if the value awarded by the court for the dissenting interest is more than 125 percent of the price offered by the limited liability company under subdivision (a) of Section 17711.02, 							 attorney’s fees and fees of expert witnesses.

18310.
  (a) Unless otherwise provided by an unincorporated association’s governing principles, membership in the unincorporated association is terminated by any of the following events:
(1) Resignation of the member.
(2) Expiration of the fixed term of the membership, unless the membership is renewed before its expiration.
(3) Expulsion of the member.
(4) Death of the member.
(5) Termination of the legal existence of a member that is not a natural person.
(b) Termination of membership does not relieve a person from an obligation incurred as a member before termination.
(c) Termination of membership does not affect the right of an unincorporated association to enforce an obligation against a person incurred as a member before termination, or to obtain damages for its breach.
(Added by Stats. 2005, Ch. 116, Sec. 5. Effective January 1, 2006.)
18320.
  (a) This section only applies if membership in an unincorporated association includes a property right or if expulsion or suspension of a member would affect an important, substantial economic interest. This section does not apply to an unincorporated association that has a religious purpose.
(b) Expulsion or suspension of a member shall be done in good faith and in a fair and reasonable manner. A procedure that satisfies the requirements of subdivision (c) is fair and reasonable, but a court may also determine that another procedure is fair and reasonable taking into account the full circumstances of the expulsion or suspension.
(c) A procedure for expulsion or suspension of a member that satisfies the following requirements is fair and reasonable:
(1) The procedure is included in the unincorporated association’s governing documents.
(2) The member to be expelled or suspended is given notice, including a statement of the reasons for the expulsion or suspension. The notice shall be delivered at least 15 days before the effective date of the expulsion or suspension.

(e) A member may commence a proceeding to challenge the expulsion or suspension of the member, including a claim alleging defective notice, within one year after the effective date of the expulsion or suspension. The court may order any relief, including reinstatement, it determines is equitable under the circumstances. A vote of the members or of the board may not be set aside solely because a person was wrongfully excluded from voting by virtue of the challenged expulsion or suspension, unless the court determines that the wrongful expulsion or suspension was in bad faith and for the purpose, and with the effect, of wrongfully excluding the member from the vote or from the meeting at which the vote took place, so as to affect the outcome of the vote.
(f) This section governs only the procedure for expulsion or suspension and not the substantive grounds for expulsion or suspension. An expulsion or suspension based on substantive grounds that violate contractual or other rights of the member or are otherwise unlawful is not made valid by compliance with this section.

The notice shall state the matter to be decided and describe how and when the vote is to be conducted.
(c) If the vote is to be conducted by written ballot, the notice of the vote shall serve as the ballot. It shall set forth the proposed action, provide an opportunity to specify approval or disapproval of any proposal, and provide a reasonable time within which to return the ballot to the unincorporated association.
(d) One-third the voting power of the association constitutes a quorum.
(e) The voting power of the association is the total number of votes that can be cast by members on a particular issue at the time the member vote is held.

PART 5. LIABILITY OF DIRECTOR OR OFFICER OF NONPROFIT MEDICAL ASSOCIATION [24001.5- 24001.5.]  ( Heading of Part 5 amended by Stats. 2004, Ch. 178, Sec. 16. )

24001.5.
  (a) The Legislature finds and declares that the services of directors or officers of nonprofit medical associations, as defined in Section 21200, who serve without compensation are critical to the efficient conduct and management of the public service and charitable affairs of the people of California. The willingness of volunteers to offer their services has been deterred by a perception that their personal assets are at risk for these activities. The unavailability and unaffordability of appropriate liability insurance makes it difficult for these associations to protect the personal assets of their volunteer decisionmakers with adequate insurance. It is the public policy of this state to provide incentive and protection to the individuals who perform these important functions.
(b) Except as provided in this section, no cause of action for monetary damages shall arise against any person serving without compensation as a director or officer of a nonprofit medical association, as defined in Section 21200, on account of any negligent act or omission occurring (1) within the scope of that person’s duties as a director acting as a board member, or within the scope of that person’s duties as an officer acting in an official capacity; (2) in good faith; (3) in a manner that the person believes to be in the best interest of the association; and (4) is in the exercise of his or her policymaking judgment.
(c) This section shall not limit the liability of a director or officer for any of the following:
(1) Self-dealing transactions, as described in Sections 5233 and 9243.
(2) Conflicts of interest, as described in Section 7233.
(3) Actions described in Sections 5237, 7236, and 9245.
(4) In the case of a charitable trust, an action or proceeding against a trustee brought by a beneficiary of that trust.
(5) Any action or proceeding brought by the Attorney General.
(6) Intentional, wanton, or reckless acts, gross negligence, or an action based on fraud, oppression, or malice.
(7) Any action brought under Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 16700) of Part 2 of Division 7 of the Business and Professions Code.
(d) This section only applies 				 to nonprofit organizations organized to provide charitable, educational, scientific, social, or other forms of public service that are exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501(c)(3) or 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code.
(e) This section applies only if the nonprofit association maintains a liability insurance policy with an amount of coverage of at least the following amounts:
(1) If the association’s annual budget is less than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), the minimum required amount is five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000).
(2) If the association’s annual budget equals or exceeds fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), the minimum required amount is one million dollars ($1,000,000).
This section applies only if the liability insurance policy is 				 applicable to the claim.
(f) For the purposes of this section, the payment of actual expenses incurred in attending meetings or otherwise in the execution of the duties of a director or officer shall not constitute compensation.
(g) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the liability of a nonprofit association for any negligent act or omission of a director, officer, employee, agent, or servant occurring within the scope of his or her duties.
(h) This section does not apply to any association that unlawfully restricts membership, services, or benefits conferred on the basis of political affiliation, age, or any characteristic listed or defined in subdivision (b) or (e) of Section 51 of the Civil Code.
(i) This section does not apply to any volunteer director or officer who receives compensation from the association in any other capacity, including, but not limited to, as an employee.

  (a) “Eligible rollup transaction” means a rollup transaction in which the new securities issued are listed or approved for listing on a national securities exchange which has been certified by the commissioner under subdivision (o) of Section 25100, if the exchange requires as a condition to listing or designation that the rollup transaction be conducted in accordance with procedures to protect the rights of limited partners.
(b) The rights of limited partners will be presumed to be protected if the rollup transaction provides for the right of dissenting limited partners:
(1) To receive compensation for their limited partnership units based on an appraisal of 				 the limited partnership assets performed by an independent appraiser unaffiliated with the sponsor or general partner of the limited partnership and which value the assets as if sold in an orderly manner in a reasonable period of time, plus or minus other balance sheet items, and less the cost of sale or refinancing. Compensation to dissenting limited partners of rollup transactions may be cash, secured debt instruments, unsecured debt instruments, or freely tradeable securities; provided, however, that:
(A) Rollups which utilize debt instruments as compensation provide for a trustee and an indenture to protect the rights of the debt holders and provide a rate of interest based upon, but not less than, the then applicable federal rate as determined in accordance with Section 1274 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
(B) Rollups which utilize unsecured debt instruments as 				 compensation, in addition to the requirements of subparagraph (A), limit total leverage to 70 percent of the appraised value of the assets.
(C) All debt securities have a term no greater than seven years and provide for prepayment with 80 percent of the net proceeds of any sale or refinancing of the assets previously owned by the entity or any part thereof.
(D) Freely tradeable securities utilized as compensation to dissenting limited partners must be issued by an issuer whose securities are listed on a national securities exchange that has been certified for at least one year prior to the transaction, and the number of securities to be received in return for limited partnership interests must be determined by an appraisal of limited partnership assets, conducted in a manner consistent with this paragraph, in relation to the average last sale price of the freely tradeable 				 securities in the 20-day period following the transaction. If the issuer of the freely tradeable securities is affiliated with the sponsor or general partner, newly issued securities to be utilized as compensation to dissenting limited partners shall not represent more than 20 percent of the issued and outstanding shares of that class of securities after giving effect to the issuance. For the purposes of the preceding sentence, a sponsor or general partner is “affiliated” with the issuer of the freely tradeable securities if the sponsor or general partner receives any material compensation from the issuer or its affiliates in conjunction with the rollup transaction or the purchase of the general partner’s interest; provided, however, that nothing herein shall restrict the ability of a sponsor or general partner to receive any payment for its equity interests and compensation as otherwise provided by this section.
(2) To receive or retain a 				 security with substantially the same terms and conditions as the security originally held, provided that the receipt or retention of that security is not a step in a series of subsequent transactions that directly or indirectly through acquisition or otherwise involves future combinations or reorganizations of one or more rollup participants. Securities received or retained will be considered to have the same terms and conditions as the security originally held if:
(A) There is no material adverse change to dissenting limited partners’ rights, including, but not limited to, rights with respect to voting, the business plan, or the investment, distribution, management compensation and liquidation policies of the limited partnership or resulting entity.
(B) The dissenting limited partners receive the same preferences, privileges, and priorities as they had pursuant to the security 				 originally held.
The rights set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2) are the only rights of dissenting limited partners to which the presumption under this subdivision applies. A general partner or sponsor shall file an application for qualification pursuant to Section 25110 or Section 25120 with respect to any other rights proposed to be offered to dissenting limited partners.
At the time a registration statement is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission with respect to an eligible rollup transaction, a general partner or sponsor shall notify, to the maximum extent permitted by the federal securities laws, each limited partner who has an address in this state by certified mail of the following: That a registration statement has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission with respect to a rollup transaction; that the general partner or sponsor claims an exemption from the review process under the law by 				 virtue of Section 25014.7, which defines “eligible rollup transaction”; that the general partner or sponsor has the burden of proof under the law that the transaction meets the definition of eligible rollup transaction; and that the commissioner does not recommend or endorse the transaction.
(c) The rights of limited partners shall be presumed not to be protected if the general partner:
(1) Converts an equity interest in the limited partnerships subject to a rollup for which consideration was not paid and which was not otherwise provided for in the limited partnership agreement and disclosed to limited partners, into a voting interest in the new entity, provided, however, an interest originally obtained in order to comply with the provisions of Internal Revenue Service Revenue Proclamation 89-12 may be converted.
(2) Fails to follow the valuation provisions in the limited partnership agreements of the subject limited partners when valuing their limited partnership interests.
(3) Utilizes a future value of their equity interest rather than the current value of their equity interest, as determined by an appraisal conducted in a manner consistent with paragraph (1) of subdivision (b), when determining their interest in the new entity.
(d) The rights of limited partners shall be presumed not to be protected as to voting rights, if:
(1) The voting rights in the entity resulting from a rollup do not generally follow the original voting rights of the limited partnerships participating in the rollup transaction.
(2) A majority of the interest in an entity 				 resulting from a rollup transaction may not, without concurrence by the sponsor, general partners, board of directors or trustee, depending on the form of entity, vote to:
(A) Amend the limited partnership agreement, articles of incorporation or bylaws, or indenture.
(B) Dissolve the entity.
(C) Remove management and elect new management.
(D) Approve or disapprove the sale of substantially all of the assets of the entity.
(3) The general partner or sponsor proposing a rollup is not required to provide each person whose equity interest is subject to the rollup transaction with a document which instructs the person on the proper procedure for voting against or dissenting from the rollup 				 transaction.
(4) The general partner or sponsor does not utilize an independent third party to receive and tabulate all votes and dissents, and require that the third party make the tabulation available to the general partner and any limited partner upon request at any time during and after voting occurs.
(e) The rights of limited partners shall be presumed not to be protected as to transaction costs if:
(1) Limited partners bear an unfair portion of the transaction costs of a proposed rollup transaction that is rejected. For purposes of this provision, transaction costs are defined as the costs of printing and mailing the proxy, prospectus, or other documents; legal fees not related to the solicitation of votes or tenders; financial advisory fees; investment banking fees; appraisal fees; accounting fees; independent 				 committee expenses; travel expenses; and all other fees related to the preparatory work of the transaction, but not including costs that would have otherwise been incurred by the subject limited partnerships in the ordinary course of business, or solicitation expenses.
(2) Transaction costs of a rejected rollup transaction are not apportioned between general and limited partners of the subject limited partnerships according to the final vote on the proposed transaction as follows:
(A) The general partner or sponsor bears all rollup transaction costs in proportion to the number of votes to reject the rollup transaction.
(B) Limited partners bear transaction costs in proportion to the number of votes to approve the rollup transaction.
(3) The dissenting 				 limited partnership is required to pay any of the costs of the rollup transaction and the general partner or sponsor is not required to pay the rollup transaction costs on behalf of the dissenting limited partnerships in a rollup in which one or more limited partnerships determines not to approve the transaction, but where the rollup transaction is consummated with respect to one or more approving limited partnerships.
(f) The rights of limited partners shall be presumed not to be protected as to fees of general partners and sponsors, if:
(1) General partners and sponsors are not prevented from receiving both unearned management fees discounted to a present value, if those fees were not previously provided for in the limited partnership agreement and disclosed to limited partners, and new asset-based fees.
(2) Property management fees and other management fees are not appropriate, not reasonable and greater than what would be paid to third parties for performing similar services.
(3) Changes in fees which are substantial and adverse to limited partners are not approved by an independent committee according to the facts and circumstances of each transaction.
(g) A general partner or sponsor proposing a rollup transaction shall pay all solicitation expenses related to the transaction, including all preparatory work related thereto, in the event the rollup transaction is not approved. For purposes of this section, “solicitation expenses” include direct marketing expenses such as telephone calls, broker-dealer factsheets, legal and other fees related to the solicitation, as well as direct solicitation compensation to brokers and dealers.
(h) A broker or dealer may not receive compensation for soliciting votes or tenders from limited partners in connection with a rollup transaction unless that compensation:
(1) Is payable and equal in amount regardless of whether the limited partner votes affirmatively or negatively in the proposed rollup.
(2) In the aggregate, does not exceed 2 percent of the exchange value of the newly created securities.
(3) Is paid regardless of whether the limited partners reject the proposed rollup transaction.

  The following securities are exempted from Sections 25110, 25120, and 25130:
(a) Any security (including a revenue obligation) issued or guaranteed by the United States, any state, any city, county, city and county, public district, public authority, public corporation, public entity, or political subdivision of a state or any agency or corporate or other instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing; or any certificate of deposit for any of the foregoing.
(b) Any security issued or guaranteed by Canada, any Canadian province, any political subdivision or municipality of that province, or by any other foreign government with which the United States currently maintains diplomatic relations, if the security is 				 recognized as a valid obligation by the issuer or guarantor; or any certificate of deposit for any of the foregoing.
(c) Any security issued or guaranteed by and representing an interest in or a direct obligation of a national bank or a bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state, and any security issued by a bank to one or more other banks and representing an interest in an asset of the issuing bank.

(e) Any security (other than an interest in all or portions of a parcel or parcels of real property which are subdivided land or a subdivision or in a real estate development), the issuance of which is subject to authorization by the Insurance Commissioner, the Public Utilities Commission, or the Real Estate Commissioner of this state.
(f) Any security consisting of any interest in all or portions of a parcel or parcels of real property that are subdivided lands or a subdivision or in a real estate development; provided that the exemption in this subdivision shall not be applicable to: (1) any investment contract sold or offered for sale with, or as part of, that interest, or (2) any person engaged in the business of selling, distributing, or supplying water for irrigation purposes or 				 domestic use that is not a public utility except that the exemption is applicable to any security of a mutual water company (other than an investment contract as described in paragraph (1)) offered or sold in connection with subdivided lands pursuant to Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 14310) of Part 7 of Division 3 of Title 1.
(g) Any mutual capital certificates or savings accounts, as defined in the Savings Association Law, issued by a savings association, as defined by subdivision (a) of Section 5102 of the Financial Code, and holding a license or certificate of authority then in force from the Commissioner of Financial Protection and Innovation of this state.
(h) Any 				 security issued or guaranteed by any federal credit union, or by any credit union organized and supervised, or regulated, under the Credit Union Law.
(i) Any security issued or guaranteed by any railroad, other common carrier, public utility, or public utility holding company which is regulated in respect of the issuance or guarantee of the security by a governmental authority of the United States, of any state, of Canada or of any Canadian province; and the security is subject to registration with or authorization of issuance by that authority.
(j) Any security (except evidences of indebtedness, whether interest bearing or not) of an issuer (1) organized exclusively for educational, benevolent, fraternal, religious, charitable, social, or reformatory purposes and not for pecuniary profit, if no part of the net earnings of the issuer inures to the benefit of any private 				 shareholder or individual, or (2) organized as a chamber of commerce or trade or professional association. The fact that amounts received from memberships or dues or both will or may be used to construct or otherwise acquire facilities for use by members of the nonprofit organization does not disqualify the organization for this exemption. This exemption does not apply to the securities of any nonprofit organization if any promoter thereof expects or intends to make a profit directly or indirectly from any business or activity associated with the organization or operation of that nonprofit organization or from remuneration received from that nonprofit organization.
(k) Any agreement, commonly known as a “life income contract,” of an issuer (1) organized exclusively for educational, benevolent, fraternal, religious, charitable, social, or reformatory purposes and not for pecuniary profit and (2) which the commissioner designates by rule or 				 order, with a donor in consideration of a donation of property to that issuer and providing for the payment to the donor or persons designated by the donor of income or specified periodic payments from the donated property or other property for the life of the donor or those other persons.
(l) Any note, draft, bill of exchange, or banker’s acceptance which is freely transferable and of prime quality, arises out of a current transaction or the proceeds of which have been or are to be used for current transactions, and which evidences an obligation to pay cash within nine months of the date of issuance, exclusive of days of grace, or any renewal of that paper which is likewise limited, or any guarantee of that paper or of that renewal, provided that the paper is not offered to the public in amounts of less than twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) in the aggregate to any one purchaser. In addition, the commissioner may, by rule or order, 				 exempt any issuer of any notes, drafts, bills of exchange, or banker’s acceptances from qualification of those securities when the commissioner finds that the qualification is not necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.
(m) Any security issued by any corporation organized and existing under the provisions of Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 54001) of Division 20 of the Food and Agricultural Code.
(n) Any beneficial interest in an employees’ pension, profit-sharing, stock bonus, or similar benefit plan which meets the requirements for qualification under Section 401 of the federal Internal Revenue Code or any statute amendatory thereof or supplementary thereto. A determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service stating that an employees’ pension, profit-sharing, stock bonus, or similar benefit plan meets those requirements shall 				 be conclusive evidence that the plan is an employees’ pension, profit-sharing, stock bonus, or similar benefit plan within the meaning of the first sentence of this subdivision until the date the determination letter is revoked in writing by the Internal Revenue Service, regardless of whether or not the revocation is retroactive.
(o) Any security listed or approved for listing upon notice of issuance on a national securities exchange, if the exchange has been certified by rule or order of the commissioner and any warrant or right to purchase or subscribe to the security. The exemption afforded by this subdivision does not apply to securities listed or approved for listing upon notice of issuance on a national securities exchange, in a rollup transaction unless the rollup transaction is an eligible rollup transaction as defined in Section 25014.7.
That certification of any exchange shall be made by the 				 commissioner upon the written request of the exchange if the commissioner finds that the exchange, in acting on applications for listing of common stock, substantially applies the minimum standards set forth in either subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1), and, in considering suspension or removal from listing, substantially applies each of the criteria set forth in paragraph (2).
(1) Listing standards:
(A) (i) Shareholders’ equity of at least four million dollars ($4,000,000).
(ii) Pretax income of at least seven hundred fifty thousand dollars ($750,000) in the issuer’s last fiscal year or in two of its last three fiscal years.
(iii) Minimum public distribution of 500,000 shares (exclusive of the holdings of officers, 				 directors, controlling shareholders, and other concentrated or family holdings), together with a minimum of 800 public holders or minimum public distribution of 1,000,000 shares together with a minimum of 400 public holders. The exchange may also consider the listing of a company’s securities if the company has a minimum of 500,000 shares publicly held, a minimum of 400 shareholders and daily trading volume in the issue has been approximately 2,000 shares or more for the six months preceding the date of application. In evaluating the suitability of an issue for listing under this trading provision, the exchange shall review the nature and frequency of that activity and any other factors as it may determine to be relevant in ascertaining whether the issue is suitable for trading. A security that trades infrequently shall not be considered for listing under this paragraph even though average daily volume amounts to 2,000 shares per day or more.
Companies whose 				 securities are concentrated in a limited geographical area, or whose securities are largely held in block by institutional investors, normally may not be considered eligible for listing unless the public distribution appreciably exceeds 500,000 shares.
(iv) Minimum price of three dollars ($3) per share for a reasonable period of time prior to the filing of a listing application; provided, however, in certain instances an exchange may favorably consider listing an issue selling for less than three dollars ($3) per share after considering all pertinent factors, including market conditions in general, whether historically the issue has sold above three dollars ($3) per share, the applicant’s capitalization, and the number of outstanding and publicly held shares of the issue.
(v) An aggregate market value for publicly held shares of at least three million dollars ($3,000,000).
(B) (i) Shareholders’ equity of at least four million dollars ($4,000,000).
(ii) Minimum public distribution set forth in clause (iii) of subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1).
(iii) Operating history of at least three years.
(iv) An aggregate market value for publicly held shares of at least fifteen million dollars ($15,000,000).
(2) Criteria for consideration of suspension or removal from listing:
(A) If a company that (i) has shareholders’ equity of less than one million dollars ($1,000,000) has sustained net losses in each of its two most recent fiscal years, or (ii) has net tangible assets of less than 				 three million dollars ($3,000,000) and has sustained net losses in three of its four most recent fiscal years.
(B) If the number of shares publicly held (excluding the holdings of officers, directors, controlling shareholders, and other concentrated or family holdings) is less than 150,000.
(C) If the total number of shareholders is less than 400 or if the number of shareholders of lots of 100 shares or more is less than 300.
(D) If the aggregate market value of shares publicly held is less than seven hundred fifty thousand dollars ($750,000).
(E) If shares of common stock sell at a price of less than three dollars ($3) per share for a substantial period of time and the issuer shall fail to effectuate a reverse stock split of the shares within a 				 reasonable period of time after being requested by the exchange to take that action.
A national securities exchange, certified by rule or order of the commissioner under this subdivision, shall file annual reports when requested to do so by the commissioner. The annual reports shall contain, by issuer: the variances granted to an exchange’s listing standards, including variances from corporate governance and voting rights’ standards, for any security of that issuer; the reasons for the variances; a discussion of the review procedure instituted by the exchange to determine the effect of the variances on investors and whether the variances should be continued; and any other information that the commissioner deems relevant. The purpose of these reports is to assist the commissioner in determining whether the quantitative and qualitative requirements of this subdivision are substantially being met by the exchange in general or with regard to any particular security.
The commissioner after appropriate notice and opportunity for hearing in accordance with the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 11500) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code) may, in the commissioner’s discretion, by rule or order, decertify any exchange previously certified that ceases substantially to apply the minimum standards or criteria as set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2).
A rule or order of certification shall conclusively establish that any security listed or approved for listing upon notice of issuance on any exchange named in a rule or order of certification, and any warrant or right to purchase or subscribe to that security, is exempt under this subdivision until the adoption by the commissioner of any rule or order decertifying the exchange.
(p) A promissory note secured by a lien 				 on real property, which is neither one of a series of notes of equal priority secured by interests in the same real property nor a note in which beneficial interests are sold to more than one person or entity.
(q) Any unincorporated interindemnity or reciprocal or interinsurance contract, that qualifies under the provisions of Section 1280.7 of the Insurance Code, between members of a cooperative corporation, organized and operating under Part 2 (commencing with Section 12200) of Division 3 of Title 1, and whose members consist only of physicians and surgeons licensed in California, which contracts indemnify solely in respect to medical malpractice claims against the members, and which do not collect in advance of loss any moneys other than contributions by each member to a collective reserve trust fund or for necessary expenses of administration.
(1) Whenever it appears to the 				 commissioner that any person has engaged or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of any provision of Section 1280.7 of the Insurance Code, the commissioner may, in the commissioner’s discretion, bring an action in the name of the people of the State of California in the superior court to enjoin the acts or practices or to enforce compliance with Section 1280.7 of the Insurance Code. Upon a proper showing a permanent or preliminary injunction, a restraining order, or a writ of mandate shall be granted and a receiver or conservator may be appointed for the defendant or the defendant’s assets.
(2) The commissioner may, in the commissioner’s discretion, (A) make public or private investigations within or outside of this state as the commissioner deems necessary to determine whether any person has violated or is about to violate any provision of Section 1280.7 of the Insurance Code or to aid in the enforcement of 				 Section 1280.7, and (B) publish information concerning the violation of Section 1280.7.
(3) For the purpose of any investigation or proceeding under this section, the commissioner or any officer designated by the commissioner may administer oaths and affirmations, subpoena witnesses, compel their attendance, take evidence, and require the production of any books, papers, correspondence, memoranda, agreements, or other documents or records which the commissioner deems relevant or material to the inquiry.
(4) In case of contumacy by, or refusal to obey a subpoena issued to, any person, the superior court, upon application by the commissioner, may issue to the person an order requiring the person to appear before the commissioner, or the officer designated by the commissioner, to produce documentary evidence, if so ordered, or to give evidence touching the matter under investigation 				 or in question. Failure to obey the order of the court may be punished by the court as contempt.
(5) No person is excused from attending or testifying or from producing any document or record before the commissioner or in obedience to the subpoena of the commissioner or any officer designated by the commissioner, or in any proceeding instituted by the commissioner, on the ground that the testimony or evidence (documentary or otherwise), required of the person may tend to incriminate the person or subject the person to a penalty or forfeiture, but no individual may be prosecuted or subjected to any penalty or forfeiture for or on account of any transaction, matter, or thing concerning which the person is compelled, after validly claiming the privilege against self-incrimination, to testify or produce evidence (documentary or otherwise), except that the individual testifying is not exempt from prosecution and punishment for perjury or contempt 				 committed in testifying.
(6) The cost of any review, examination, audit, or investigation made by the commissioner under Section 1280.7 of the Insurance Code shall be paid to the commissioner by the person subject to the review, examination, audit, or investigation, and the commissioner may maintain an action for the recovery of these costs in any court of competent jurisdiction. In determining the cost, the commissioner may use the actual amount of the salary or other compensation paid to the persons making the review, examination, audit, or investigation plus the actual amount of expenses including overhead reasonably incurred in the performance of the work.

25102.
  The following transactions are exempted from the provisions of Section 25110:
(a) Any offer (but not a sale) not involving any public offering and the execution and delivery of any agreement for the sale of securities pursuant to the offer if (1) the agreement contains substantially the following provision: “The sale of the securities that are the subject of this agreement has not been qualified with the Commissioner of Financial Protection and Innovation and the issuance of the securities or the payment or receipt of any part of the consideration therefor prior to the qualification is unlawful, unless the sale of securities is exempt from the qualification by Section 25100, 25102, or 25105 of the California Corporations Code. The rights of all parties to this agreement are expressly 				 conditioned upon the qualification being obtained, unless the sale is so exempt;” and (2) no part of the purchase price is paid or received and none of the securities are issued until the sale of the securities is qualified under this law unless the sale of securities is exempt from the qualification by this section or Section 25100 or 25105.
(b) Any offer (but not a sale) of a security for which a registration statement has been filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, but has not yet become effective, or for which an offering statement under Regulation A has been filed but has not yet been qualified, if no stop order or refusal order is in effect and no public proceeding or examination looking towards an order is pending under Section 8 of the act and no order under Section 25140 or subdivision (a) of Section 25143 is in effect under this law.
(c) Any offer (but not a 				 sale) and the execution and delivery of any agreement for the sale of securities pursuant to the offer as may be permitted by the commissioner upon application. Any negotiating permit under this subdivision shall be conditioned to the effect that none of the securities may be issued and none of the consideration therefor may be received or accepted until the sale of the securities is qualified under this law.
(d) Any transaction or agreement between the issuer and an underwriter or among underwriters if the sale of the securities is qualified, or exempt from qualification, at the time of distribution thereof in this state, if any.
(e) Any offer or sale of any evidence of indebtedness, whether secured or unsecured, and any guarantee thereof, in a transaction not involving any public offering.
(f) Any offer or sale of 				 any security in a transaction (other than an offer or sale to a pension or profit-sharing trust of the issuer) that meets each of the following criteria:
(1) Sales of the security are not made to more than 35 persons, including persons not in this state.
(2) All purchasers either have a preexisting personal or business relationship with the offeror or any of its partners, officers, directors or controlling persons, or managers (as appointed or elected by the members) if the offeror is a limited liability company, or by reason of their business or financial experience or the business or financial experience of their professional advisers who are unaffiliated with and who are not compensated by the issuer or any affiliate or selling agent of the issuer, directly or indirectly, could be reasonably assumed to have the capacity to protect their own interests in connection with the 				 transaction.
(3) Each purchaser represents that the purchaser is purchasing for the purchaser’s own account (or a trust account if the purchaser is a trustee) and not with a view to or for sale in connection with any distribution of the security.
(4) The offer and sale of the security is not accomplished by the publication of any advertisement. The number of purchasers referred to above is exclusive of any described in subdivision (i), any officer, director, or affiliate of the issuer, or manager (as appointed or elected by the members) if the issuer is a limited liability company, and any other purchaser who the commissioner designates by rule. For purposes of this section, spouses (together with any custodian or trustee acting for the account of their minor children) are counted as one person and a partnership, corporation, or other organization that was not specifically formed 				 for the purpose of purchasing the security offered in reliance upon this exemption, is counted as one person. The commissioner shall by rule require the issuer to file a notice of transactions under this subdivision.
The failure to file the notice or the failure to file the notice within the time specified by the rule of the commissioner shall not affect the availability of the exemption. Any issuer that fails to file the notice as provided by rule of the commissioner shall, within 15 business days after discovery of the failure to file the notice or after demand by the commissioner, whichever occurs first, file the notice and pay to the commissioner a fee equal to the fee payable had the transaction been qualified under Section 25110. Neither the filing of the notice nor the failure by the commissioner to comment thereon precludes the commissioner from taking any action that the commissioner deems necessary or appropriate under this division with respect to the 				 offer and sale of the securities.
(g) Any offer or sale of conditional sale agreements, equipment trust certificates, or certificates of interest or participation therein or partial assignments thereof, covering the purchase of railroad rolling stock or equipment or the purchase of motor vehicles, aircraft, or parts thereof, in a transaction not involving any public offering.
(h) Any offer or sale of voting common stock by a corporation incorporated in any state if, immediately after the proposed sale and issuance, there will be only one class of stock of the corporation outstanding that is owned beneficially by no more than 35 persons, provided all of the following requirements have been met:
(1) The offer and sale of the stock is not accompanied by the publication of any advertisement, and no selling expenses have 				 been given, paid, or incurred in connection therewith.
(2) The consideration to be received by the issuer for the stock to be issued consists of any of the following:
(A) Only assets (which may include cash) of an existing business enterprise transferred to the issuer upon its initial organization, of which all of the persons who are to receive the stock to be issued pursuant to this exemption were owners during, and the enterprise was operated for, a period of not less than one year immediately preceding the proposed issuance, and the ownership of the enterprise immediately prior to the proposed issuance was in the same proportions as the shares of stock are to be issued.
(B) Only cash or cancellation of indebtedness for money borrowed, or both, upon the initial organization of the issuer, provided all of the stock 				 is issued for the same price per share.
(C) Only cash, provided the sale is approved in writing by each of the existing shareholders and the purchaser or purchasers are existing shareholders.
(D) In a case where after the proposed issuance there will be only one owner of the stock of the issuer, only any legal consideration.
(3) No promotional consideration has been given, paid, or incurred in connection with the issuance. Promotional consideration means any consideration paid directly or indirectly to a person who, acting alone or in conjunction with one or more other persons, takes the initiative in founding and organizing the business or enterprise of an issuer for services rendered in connection with the founding or organizing.
(4) A notice in a 				 form prescribed by rule of the commissioner, signed by an active member of the State Bar of California, is filed with or mailed for filing to the commissioner not later than 10 business days after receipt of consideration for the securities by the issuer. That notice shall contain an opinion of the member of the State Bar of California that the exemption provided by this subdivision is available for the offer and sale of the securities. The failure to file the notice as required by this subdivision and the rules of the commissioner shall not affect the availability of this exemption. An issuer who fails to file the notice within the time specified by this subdivision shall, within 15 business days after discovery of the failure to file the notice or after demand by the commissioner, whichever occurs first, file the notice and pay to the commissioner a fee equal to the fee payable had the transaction been qualified under Section 25110. The notice, except when filed on behalf of a California corporation, shall 				 be accompanied by an irrevocable consent, in the form that the commissioner by rule prescribes, appointing the commissioner or the commissioner’s successor in office to be the issuer’s attorney to receive service of any lawful process in any noncriminal suit, action, or proceeding against it or its successor that arises under this law or any rule or order hereunder after the consent has been filed, with the same force and validity as if served personally on the issuer. An issuer on whose behalf a consent has been filed in connection with a previous qualification or exemption from qualification under this law (or application for a permit under any prior law if the application or notice under this law states that the consent is still effective) need not file another. Service may be made by leaving a copy of the process in the office of the commissioner, but it is not effective unless (A) the plaintiff, who may be the commissioner in a suit, action, or proceeding instituted by the commissioner, forthwith sends 				 notice of the service and a copy of the process by registered or certified mail to the defendant or respondent at its last address on file with the commissioner, and (B) the plaintiff’s affidavit of compliance with this section is filed in the case on or before the return day of the process, if any, or within the further time as the court allows.
(5) Each purchaser represents that the purchaser is purchasing for the purchaser’s own account, or a trust account if the purchaser is a trustee, and not with a view to or for sale in connection with any distribution of the stock.
For the purposes of this subdivision, all securities held by spouses, whether or not jointly, shall be considered to be owned by one person, and all securities held by a corporation that has issued stock pursuant to this exemption shall be considered to be held by the shareholders to whom it has issued the stock.
All stock issued by a corporation pursuant to this subdivision as it existed prior to the effective date of the amendments to this section made during the 1996 portion of the 1995–96 Regular Session that required the issuer to have stamped or printed prominently on the face of the stock certificate a legend in a form prescribed by rule of the commissioner restricting transfer of the stock in a manner provided for by that rule shall not be subject to the transfer restriction legend requirement and, by operation of law, the corporation is authorized to remove that transfer restriction legend from the certificates of those shares of stock issued by the corporation pursuant to this subdivision as it existed prior to the effective date of the amendments to this section made during the 1996 portion of the 1995–96 Regular Session.
(i) Any offer or sale (1) to a bank, savings and loan association, trust company, 				 insurance company, investment company registered under the federal Investment Company Act of 1940, pension or profit-sharing trust (other than a pension or profit-sharing trust of the issuer, a self-employed individual retirement plan, or individual retirement account), or other institutional investor or governmental agency or instrumentality that the commissioner may designate by rule, whether the purchaser is acting for itself or as trustee, or (2) to any corporation with outstanding securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or any wholly owned subsidiary of the corporation that after the offer and sale will own directly or indirectly 100 percent of the outstanding capital stock of the issuer, provided the purchaser represents that it is purchasing for its own account (or for the trust account) for investment and not with a view to or for sale in connection with any distribution of the security.
(j) Any 				 offer or sale of any certificate of interest or participation in an oil or gas title or lease (including subsurface gas storage and payments out of production) if either of the following apply:
(1) All of the purchasers meet one of the following requirements:

(B) Are persons described in paragraph (1) of subdivision (i).
(C) Have been found by the commissioner upon written application to be substantially engaged in the business of drilling for, producing, or refining oil or gas so as not to require the protection provided by this law 				 (which finding shall be effective until rescinded).
(2) The security is concurrently hypothecated to a bank in the ordinary course of business to secure a loan made by the bank, provided that each purchaser represents that it is purchasing for its own account for investment and not with a view to or for sale in connection with any distribution of the security.
(k) Any offer or sale of any security under, or pursuant to, a plan of reorganization under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law that has been confirmed or is subject to confirmation by the decree or order of a court of competent jurisdiction.
(l) Any offer or sale of an option, warrant, put, call, or straddle, and any guarantee of any of these securities, by a person who is not the issuer of the security subject to the right, if the transaction, had 				 it involved an offer or sale of the security subject to the right by the person, would not have violated Section 25110 or 25130.
(m) Any offer or sale of a stock to a pension, profit-sharing, stock bonus, or employee stock ownership plan, provided that (1) the plan meets the requirements for qualification under Section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code, and (2) the employees are not required or permitted individually to make any contributions to the plan. The exemption provided by this subdivision shall not be affected by whether the stock is contributed to the plan, purchased from the issuer with contributions by the issuer or an affiliate of the issuer, or purchased from the issuer with funds borrowed from the issuer, an affiliate of the issuer, or any other lender.
(n) Any offer or sale of any security in a transaction, other than an offer or sale of a security in a rollup 				 transaction, that meets all of the following criteria:
(1) The issuer is (A) a California corporation or foreign corporation that, at the time of the filing of the notice required under this subdivision, is subject to Section 2115, or (B) any other form of business entity, including without limitation a partnership or trust organized under the laws of this state. The exemption provided by this subdivision is not available to a “blind pool” issuer, as that term is defined by the commissioner, or to an investment company subject to the federal Investment Company Act of 1940.
(2) Sales of securities are made only to qualified purchasers or other persons the issuer reasonably believes, after reasonable inquiry, to be qualified purchasers. A corporation, partnership, or other organization specifically formed for the purpose of acquiring the securities offered by the issuer in reliance 				 upon this exemption may be a qualified purchaser if each of the equity owners of the corporation, partnership, or other organization is a qualified purchaser. Qualified purchasers include the following:
(A) A person designated in Section 260.102.13 of Title 10 of the California Code of Regulations.
(B) A person designated in subdivision (i) or any rule of the commissioner adopted thereunder.
(C) A pension or profit-sharing trust of the issuer, a self-employed individual retirement plan, or an individual retirement account, if the investment decisions made on behalf of the trust, plan, or account are made solely by persons who are qualified purchasers.

(E) With respect to the offer and sale of one class of voting common stock of an issuer or of preferred stock of an issuer entitling the holder thereof to at least the same voting rights as the issuer’s one class of voting common stock, provided that the issuer has only one-class voting common stock outstanding upon consummation of the offer and sale, a natural person who, either individually or jointly with the person’s spouse, (i) has a minimum net worth of two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) and had, during the immediately preceding tax year, gross income in excess of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) and reasonably expects gross income in excess of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) during the current tax year or (ii) has a minimum net 				 worth of five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000). “Net worth” shall be determined exclusive of home, home furnishings, and automobiles. Other assets included in the computation of net worth may be valued at fair market value.
Each natural person specified above, by reason of that person’s business or financial experience, or the business or financial experience of that person’s professional adviser, who is unaffiliated with and who is not compensated, directly or indirectly, by the issuer or any affiliate or selling agent of the issuer, can be reasonably assumed to have the capacity to protect that person’s interests in connection with the transaction. The amount of the investment of each natural person shall not exceed 10 percent of the net worth, as determined by this subparagraph, of that natural person.
(F) Any other purchaser designated as qualified by rule of the commissioner.
(3) Each purchaser represents that the purchaser is purchasing for the purchaser’s own account (or trust account, if the purchaser is a trustee) and not with a view to or for sale in connection with a distribution of the security.
(4) Each natural person purchaser, including a corporation, partnership, or other organization specifically formed by natural persons for the purpose of acquiring the securities offered by the issuer, receives, at least five business days before securities are sold to, or a commitment to purchase is accepted from, the purchaser, a written offering disclosure statement that shall meet the disclosure requirements of Regulation D (17 C.F.R. 230.501 et seq.), and any other information as may be prescribed by rule of the commissioner, provided that the issuer shall not be obligated pursuant to this paragraph to provide this disclosure statement to a natural 				 person qualified under Section 260.102.13 of Title 10 of the California Code of Regulations. The offer or sale of securities pursuant to a disclosure statement required by this paragraph that is in violation of Section 25401, or that fails to meet the disclosure requirements of Regulation D (17 C.F.R. 230.501 et seq.), shall not render unavailable to the issuer the claim of an exemption from Section 25110 afforded by this subdivision. This paragraph does not impose, directly or indirectly, any additional disclosure obligation with respect to any other exemption from qualification available under any other provision of this section.
(5) (A) A general announcement of proposed offering may be published by written document only, provided that the general announcement of proposed offering sets forth the following required information:
(i) The name of the issuer of 				 the securities.

(iii) The anticipated suitability standards for prospective purchasers.
(iv) A statement that (I) no money or other consideration is being solicited or will be accepted, (II) an indication of interest made by a prospective purchaser involves no obligation or commitment of any kind, and, if the issuer is required by paragraph (4) to deliver a disclosure statement to prospective purchasers, (III) no sales will be made or commitment to purchase accepted until five business days after delivery of a disclosure statement and subscription information to the prospective purchaser in accordance with the requirements of this subdivision.
(v) Any other information required by rule of the 				 commissioner.
(vi) The following legend: “For more complete information about (Name of Issuer) and (Full Title of Security), send for additional information from (Name and Address) by sending this coupon or calling (Telephone Number).”
(B) The general announcement of proposed offering referred to in subparagraph (A) may also set forth the following information:
(i) A brief description of the business of the issuer.
(ii) The geographic location of the issuer and its business.

(C) The general announcement of proposed offering shall contain only the information that is set forth in this paragraph.
(D) Dissemination of the general announcement of proposed offering to persons who are not qualified purchasers, without more, shall not disqualify the issuer from claiming the exemption under this subdivision.
(6) No telephone solicitation shall be permitted until the issuer has determined that the prospective purchaser to be solicited is a qualified purchaser.
(7) The issuer files a notice of transaction under this subdivision both (A) concurrent with the publication of a general announcement of proposed offering or at the time of the initial offer of the securities, whichever occurs first, accompanied by a filing fee, and (B) within 				 10 business days following the close or abandonment of the offering, but in no case more than 210 days from the date of filing the first notice. The first notice of transaction under subparagraph (A) shall contain an undertaking, in a form acceptable to the commissioner, to deliver any disclosure statement required by paragraph (4) to be delivered to prospective purchasers, and any supplement thereto, to the commissioner within 10 days of the commissioner’s request for the information. The exemption from qualification afforded by this subdivision is unavailable if an issuer fails to file the first notice required under subparagraph (A) or to pay the filing fee. The commissioner has the authority to assess an administrative penalty of up to one thousand dollars ($1,000) against an issuer that fails to deliver the disclosure statement required to be delivered to the commissioner upon the commissioner’s request within the time period set forth above. Neither the filing of the disclosure statement nor the 				 failure by the commissioner to comment thereon precludes the commissioner from taking any action deemed necessary or appropriate under this division with respect to the offer and sale of the securities.
(o) An offer or sale of any security issued by a corporation or limited liability company pursuant to a purchase plan or agreement, or issued pursuant to an option plan or agreement, where the security at the time of issuance or grant is exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to Rule 701 adopted pursuant to that act (17 C.F.R. 230.701), the provisions of which are hereby incorporated by reference into this section, provided that (1) the terms of any purchase plan or agreement shall comply with Sections 260.140.42, 260.140.45, and 260.140.46 of Title 10 of the California Code of Regulations, (2) the terms of any option plan or agreement shall comply with Sections 260.140.41, 260.140.45, and 260.140.46 of 				 Title 10 of the California Code of Regulations, and (3) the issuer files a notice of transaction in accordance with rules adopted by the commissioner no later than 30 days after the initial issuance of any security under that plan, accompanied by a filing fee as prescribed by subdivision (y) of Section 25608. The failure to file the notice of transaction within the time specified in this subdivision shall not affect the availability of this exemption. An issuer that fails to file the notice shall, within 15 business days after discovery of the failure to file the notice or after demand by the commissioner, whichever occurs first, file the notice and pay the commissioner a fee equal to the maximum aggregate fee payable had the transaction been qualified under Section 25110.
Offers and sales exempt pursuant to this subdivision shall be deemed to be part of a single, discrete offering and are not subject to integration with any other offering or sale, whether qualified 				 under Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 25110), or otherwise exempt, or not subject to qualification.
(p) An offer or sale of nonredeemable securities to accredited investors (Section 28031) by a person licensed under the Capital Access Company Law (Division 3 (commencing with Section 28000) of Title 4), provided that all purchasers either (1) have a preexisting personal or business relationship with the offeror or any of its partners, officers, directors, controlling persons, or managers (as appointed or elected by the members), or (2) by reason of their business or financial experience or the business or financial experience of their professional advisers who are unaffiliated with and who are not compensated by the issuer or any affiliate or selling agent of the issuer, directly or indirectly, could be reasonably assumed to have the capacity to protect their own interests in connection with the transaction. All nonredeemable securities shall 				 be evidenced by certificates that shall have stamped or printed prominently on their face a legend in a form to be prescribed by rule or order of the commissioner restricting transfer of the securities in the manner as the rule or order provides. The exemption under this subdivision shall not be available for any offering that is exempt or asserted to be exempt pursuant to Section 3(a)(11) of the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. Sec. 77c(a)(11)) or Rule 147 (17 C.F.R. 230.147) thereunder or otherwise is conducted by means of any form of general solicitation or general advertising.

(1) The exchange incident to a merger, consolidation, or sale of assets or the entity conversion transaction, had the exchange transaction involved the issuance of a security in a transaction subject to the provisions of Section 25110, would have been exempt from qualification by subdivision (f) of Section 25102, without giving effect to paragraph (3) thereof, and either of the following is applicable:

(2) The 				 commissioner may, by rule, require the acquiring or surviving entity to file a notice of transaction under this section. However, the failure to file the notice or the failure to file the notice within the time specified by the rule of the commissioner shall not affect the availability of this exemption. An acquiring or surviving entity that fails to file the notice as provided by rule of the commissioner shall, within 15 business days after demand by the commissioner, file the notice and pay to the commissioner a fee equal to the fee payable had the transaction been qualified under Section 25110 or 25120.

(Amended by Stats. 1997, Ch. 391, Sec. 10. Effective January 1, 1998.)

(b) Except as provided in subdivision (d), an application for qualification under this section shall contain the following information and be accompanied by the following documents, in addition to the information specified in Section 25160 and the consent to service of process required by Section 25165: (1) a copy of the registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, together with all exhibits (other than exhibits incorporated by reference and those specified by rule of the commissioner, unless requested by the commissioner); (2) an undertaking to forward to the commissioner all future amendments to the registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, other than an amendment that merely delays the effective date of the registration statement, promptly and in any event not later than the first business day after the day they are forwarded to or filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, whichever first occurs; and (3) other information required to evidence compliance with any rules of the commissioner. The application must be filed with the commissioner not later than the fifth business day following filing of the registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, unless that time is extended by rule or order of the commissioner.
(c) Except as provided in subdivision (d), qualification of the sale of securities under this section automatically becomes effective (and the securities may be offered and sold in accordance with the terms of the application as amended) at the moment the federal registration statement becomes effective if all the following conditions are satisfied: (1) no stop order or order under subdivision (a) of Section 25143 is in effect under this law; (2) the application has been on file with the commissioner for at least 10 days; and (3) a statement of the maximum and minimum proposed offering prices and the maximum underwriting discounts and commissions has been on file for two business days or such shorter period as the commissioner permits by rule or order and the offering is made within those limitations. The applicant shall promptly notify the commissioner by telephone or telegram of the date and time when the federal registration statement became effective and the content of the price amendment, if any, and shall promptly file a posteffective amendment to the application containing the information and documents in the price amendment. “Price amendment” means the final federal amendment that includes a statement of the offering price, underwriting and selling discounts or commissions, amount of proceeds, interest, dividend or conversion rates, call prices and other matters related to the offering price. Upon failure to receive the required notification and posteffective amendment with respect to the price amendment, the commissioner may enter a stop order, without notice or hearing, retroactively denying effectiveness to the application for qualification or suspending its effectiveness until compliance with this subdivision, if he or she promptly notifies the applicant by telephone or telegram (and promptly confirms by letter or telegram when he or she notifies by telephone) of the issuance of the order. If the applicant proves compliance with the requirements of this subdivision as to notice and posteffective amendment, the stop order is void as of the time of its entry. The commissioner may by rule or order waive either or both of the conditions specified in clauses (2) and (3) of this subdivision. If the federal registration statement becomes effective before all the conditions in this subdivision are satisfied and they are not waived, the application for qualification automatically becomes effective as soon as all the conditions are satisfied. If the applicant advises the commissioner of the date when the federal registration statement is expected to become effective, the commissioner shall promptly advise the applicant by telephone or telegram, at the applicant’s expense, whether all the conditions are satisfied and whether he or she then contemplates the institution of a proceeding under Section 25140 or 25143; but this advice by the commissioner does not preclude the institution of such a proceeding at any time.
(d) (1) An open-end investment company or a unit investment trust that has previously qualified the sale of its securities pursuant to this section shall, in lieu of filing the application specified in subdivision (b), file pursuant to this subdivision if it has made no material change in its offering and if it is in compliance with all terms of its prior qualification. An application filed pursuant to this subdivision shall contain the following information and be accompanied by the following documents, in addition to the information specified in Section 25160 and the consent to service of process required by Section 25165: (A) a statement that the applicant has made no material change in its offering and that it is in compliance with the terms of its qualification; and (B) a copy of its current registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933.
If no stop order or orders under subdivision (a) of Section 25143 are in effect under this law, qualification of the sale of securities under this subdivision automatically becomes effective (and the securities may be offered and sold in accordance with the terms of the application) upon the day following the expiration of its prior qualification pursuant to this section or, if that qualification has expired, upon the first business day following the filing of the application pursuant to this subdivision. Nothing contained in this subdivision shall restrict the authority of the commissioner pursuant to Section 25140 or 25143.
(2) A unit investment trust that has not previously applied to qualify the sale of its securities pursuant to this section but that is substantially the same as one or more unit investment trusts previously qualified under this section by the same sponsor, shall file pursuant to this subdivision if it can make the statements specified below. An application filed pursuant to this subdivision shall contain the following information and be accompanied by the following documents, in addition to the information specified in Section 25160 and the consent to service of process required by Section 25165: (A) a statement that the applicant, in its organization, its plan of business, its securities and its offering, is substantially the same as a unit investment trust previously qualified under this section by the same sponsor; (B) a statement that those previously qualified unit investment trusts are in compliance with the terms of their qualifications and (C) a copy of its current registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933. If no stop order or orders under subdivision (a) of Section 25143 are in effect under this law, qualification of the sale of securities under this subdivision automatically becomes effective (and the security may be offered and sold in accordance with the terms of the application) at the moment the federal registration becomes effective or, if the registration is effective when the application is filed, upon the first business day following the filing of the application pursuant to this subdivision.
(Amended by Stats. 1996, Ch. 41, Sec. 3. Effective May 6, 1996.)

(b) An application for qualification under this section shall contain such information and be accompanied by such documents as shall be required by rule of the commissioner, in addition to the information specified in Section 25160 and the consent to service of process required by Section 25165.

(C) The minimum offering price of the voting common stock and preferred stock (and the conversion price if the preferred stock is convertible into the voting common stock) to be sold is two dollars ($2) per share and the applicant files an undertaking with the commissioner that there will be no stock splits, stock dividends, spinoffs, or mergers for a period of two years from the close of the offering.

(c) Qualification of securities under this section becomes effective upon the commissioner issuing a permit authorizing the issuance of those securities.
(d) The commissioner shall annually prepare a report, and make that report publicly available by posting the report on the department’s Internet Web site, summarizing data collected from persons to which it issues permits pursuant to this section. The report shall include, but not be limited to, a summary of the general categories of investments for which permits are approved; the minimum, maximum, and average net worth required of those persons 				 to whom permits are issued for each category of activity; the least stringent and most stringent suitability standards imposed on persons issued permits for each category of activity; the experience requirements imposed on persons issued permits for each category of activity; the total dollar amount of money sought to be raised per category of activity; the number and nature of enforcement actions taken against permitholders; and any other information the commissioner deems relevant to inform the Legislature about the activities of permitholders and the protections for those who invest with permitholders. The commissioner shall take steps to ensure that the publication of data collected from permitholders does not result in the release of proprietary information about individuals or businesses.
(e) The commissioner may examine those persons to whom permits are issued pursuant to this section to review compliance with the conditions of the permit and other applicable state law. The commissioner may disqualify an offering permitted pursuant to this section if he or she finds that the issuer has materially violated the provisions of its permit.

CHAPTER 5. Authority of the Commissioner [25140 - 25151]  ( Chapter 5 added by Stats. 1968, Ch. 88. )

25140.
  (a) (1) The commissioner may issue a stop order denying effectiveness to, or suspending or revoking the effectiveness of, any qualification of an underwritten offering of securities under Section 25111, 25112 or 25131 or may suspend or revoke any permit issued under Section 25113 or 25122 if he or she finds (A) that the order is in the public interest and (B) that the proposed plan of business of the issuer or the proposed issuance or sale of securities is not fair, just, or equitable, or that the issuer does not intend to transact its business fairly and honestly, or that the securities proposed to be issued or the method to be used in issuing them will tend to work a fraud upon the purchaser thereof.
(2) In the case of an application for or qualification of securities under Section 25111, 25112, or 25131 that is not an underwritten offering of securities, the commissioner may issue a stop order denying effectiveness to, or suspending or revoking the effectiveness of the qualification unless he or she finds (A) that the stop order is not in the public interest and (B) that the proposed plan of business of the applicant or the proposed issuance of securities is fair, just, and equitable, that the issuer intends to transact its business fairly and honestly, and that the securities that the issuer proposes to issue or the method to be used in issuing them are not such as will work a fraud upon the purchaser thereof.
(b) The commissioner may refuse to issue a permit under Section 25113 unless he or she finds that the proposed plan of business of the applicant and the proposed issuance of securities are fair, just, and equitable, that the applicant intends to transact its business fairly and honestly, and that the securities which it proposes to issue and the methods to be used by it in issuing them are not such as, in his or her opinion, will work a fraud upon the purchaser thereof.
(c) The commissioner may refuse to issue a permit under Section 25122 unless he or she finds that the proposed plan of recapitalization or reorganization and the proposed issuance of securities are fair, just, and equitable to all security holders affected.
(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivisions (a) and (b) of this section, the commissioner shall not have authority to issue any stop order or to refuse to issue or to suspend or revoke any permit on the basis that the price at which the security is to be offered is unfair, unjust or inequitable in any case where the security is being publicly offered for cash pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 and the offering is the subject of a firm commitment underwriting by an underwriter or syndicate of underwriters all of whom are registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. For the purposes of this subdivision a firm commitment underwriting means an underwriting pursuant to which the underwriter or syndicate of underwriters is committed to take up and pay for the securities subject only to the usual or customary conditions, but not including any “market out” or similar condition operative after the time of commencement of the offering. (A condition relating to the suspension of all trading on a national securities exchange, a banking holiday, war, civil insurrection, or the like is not a “market out” or similar condition within the meaning of this subdivision.) Nothing contained in this subdivision shall deny authority to the commissioner to issue a stop order or to refuse to issue or to suspend or revoke a permit because of unreasonable discounts, commissions or other compensation to underwriters, sellers or others, unreasonable promoters’ profits or participations or unreasonable amounts or kinds of options.
(Amended by Stats. 1990, Ch. 1035, Sec. 2.)
25141.
  The commissioner may impose as a condition of qualification under Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 25110) or Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 25120) of this part conditions requiring the deposit in escrow of securities, imposing a legend condition restricting the transferability thereof, impounding the proceeds from the sale thereof, limiting the expense in connection with the sale thereof, requiring the waiver of assets, dividends or voting rights by the holders of promotional securities, or any other condition if the commissioner finds that without such condition the offering will be unfair, unjust or inequitable. The commissioner may in his or her discretion modify or remove any such conditions when in his or her opinion they are no longer necessary or appropriate.
(Amended by Stats. 1996, Ch. 41, Sec. 6. Effective May 6, 1996.)
25142.
  When application is made for a permit to issue securities or to deliver other consideration (whether or not the security or transaction is exempt from qualification or not required to be qualified) in exchange for one or more bona fide outstanding securities, claims, or property interests, or partly in such exchange and partly for cash, the commissioner is expressly authorized to approve the terms and conditions of such issuance and exchange or such delivery and exchange and the fairness of such terms and conditions, and is expressly authorized to hold a hearing upon the fairness of such terms and conditions, at which all persons to whom it is proposed to issue securities or to deliver such other consideration in such exchange have the right to appear. The application for a permit to deliver consideration other than securities shall be in such form, contain such information and be accompanied by such documents as shall be required by rule of the commissioner or, in the absence thereof, in substantially the form of an application filed pursuant to Section 25121.
(Amended by Stats. 1977, Ch. 235.)
25143.
  (a) The commissioner may by order summarily postpone or suspend the effectiveness of any qualification pending final determination of any proceeding under this chapter. Upon the entry of the order, the commissioner shall promptly notify each person specified in subdivision (b) of this section that it has been entered and of the reasons therefor and that upon the receipt of a written request the matter will be set down for hearing to commence within 15 business days after such receipt unless the applicant consents to a later date. If no hearing is requested and none is ordered by the commissioner, the order will remain in effect until it is modified or vacated by the commissioner. If a hearing is requested or ordered, the commissioner, after notice and hearing in accordance with subdivision (b) of this section, may modify or vacate the order or extend it until final determination.
(b) No stop order may be entered under this chapter except under subdivision (a) of this section without appropriate prior notice to the applicant, the issuer, and the person on whose behalf the securities are to be or have been offered and hearing in accordance with the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 11500) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code, in connection with which the commissioner shall have all of the powers granted thereunder. In the case of qualification by permit, such hearing shall be held upon such notice within 20 business days after a written request therefor by the applicant unless the permit is issued prior to the expiration of such period or the applicant consents to a later date.
(Amended by Stats. 1973, Ch. 390.)
25144.
  The commissioner may vacate or modify a stop order if he finds that the conditions which caused its entry have changed or that it is otherwise in the public interest to do so.
(Added by Stats. 1968, Ch. 88.)
25145.
  Every issuer qualifying securities for sale in this state shall at all times keep and maintain a complete set of books, records, and accounts of such sales and the disposition of the proceeds thereof, and shall thereafter, at such times as are required by the commissioner, make and file in the office of the commissioner a report, setting forth the securities sold by it under such qualification, the proceeds derived therefrom and the disposition thereof.
(Added by Stats. 1968, Ch. 88.)
25146.
  For a period of 18 months after the qualification is effective, the commissioner may by rule or order require an issuer who has filed an application to file reports not more often than semiannually for the purpose of keeping reasonably current the information contained in the application; provided, that the commissioner may not require the filing of any such report after completion of the offering if a nonissuer transaction in the security would be entitled to exemption under Section 25101.
(Amended by Stats. 1988, Ch. 598, Sec. 2.)
25147.
  The commissioner may by rule or order require as a condition of qualification that any security qualified under Section 25113 be sold only on a specified form of subscription or sale contract, and that a signed or conformed copy of each contract be preserved for any period up to three years specified in the rule or order.

CHAPTER 6. General Provisions [25160 - 25166]  ( Chapter 6 added by Stats. 1968, Ch. 88. )

25160.
  Every application for qualification shall state (1) the maximum amount of securities proposed to be offered in this state; and (2) any adverse order, judgment, or decree entered in connection with the offering by the regulatory authority in any state or by any court or by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Verification of an application shall be in the manner provided in the Code of Civil Procedure for the verification of pleadings. All information required to be included in an application shall be true and complete as of the time the qualification of the sale of securities becomes effective; and an applicant shall promptly supply by amendment prior to the effectiveness of such qualification any information based on facts occurring after the original date of filing which is necessary to supplement or correct the information contained in the original application so as to make such information not materially misleading as of the effective date of such qualification.
(Added by Stats. 1968, Ch. 88.)
25161.
  Any document filed under this law or a predecessor statute may be incorporated by reference in a subsequent application or notice filing if it was filed within four years prior to the filing of the application or notice filing, or is otherwise available in the files of the commissioner, to the extent that the document is currently accurate.
(Amended by Stats. 1997, Ch. 391, Sec. 13. Effective January 1, 1998.)
25162.
  An amendment to an application filed after the effective date of the qualification of the sale of securities, if such amendment is approved by the commissioner, shall become effective on such date as the commissioner may determine, having due regard to the public interest and the protection of investors.
(Added by Stats. 1968, Ch. 88.)
25163.
  In any proceeding under this law, the burden of proving an exemption or an exception from a definition is upon the person claiming it.
(Added by Stats. 1968, Ch. 88.)
25164.
  (a) Neither (1) the fact that an application for qualification under this law has been filed nor (2) the fact that such qualification has become effective constitutes a finding by the commissioner that any document filed under this law is true, complete, or not misleading. Neither any such fact nor the fact that a notice is filed or an exemption is available for a security or a transaction means that the commissioner has passed in any way upon the merits or qualifications of, or recommended or given approval to, any person, security or transaction (except as provided in Section 25142).
(b) It is unlawful to make or cause to be made to any prospective purchaser any representation inconsistent with subdivision (a) of this section.
(c) Every permit issued by the commissioner shall recite in bold type that the issuance thereof is permissive only and does not constitute a recommendation or endorsement of the securities permitted to be issued.
(Amended by Stats. 1997, Ch. 391, Sec. 14. Effective January 1, 1998.)
25165.
  Every applicant for qualification of the sale of securities under this law or every person filing an application or a notice under Sections 25100.1, 25101.1, 25102.1, and 25230.1 or a request for or notice of an exemption from qualification (other than a California corporation, California limited partnership, California limited liability company, or a person licensed as a broker-dealer in this state) shall file with the commissioner, in such form as prescribed by rule, an irrevocable consent appointing the commissioner or his or her successor in office to be the applicant’s or person’s attorney to receive service of any lawful process in any noncriminal suit, action or proceeding against the applicant or person or the successor, executor or administrator thereof, which 				 arises under this law or any rule or order hereunder after the consent has been filed, with the same force and validity as if served personally on the person filing the consent. A person who has filed such a consent in connection with a previous qualification under this law (or application for a permit under any prior law if the application under this law states that such consent is still effective), or in connection with a notice filing under Section 25100.1, 25101.1, 25102.1, and 25230.1, need not file another. Service may be made by leaving a copy of the process in the office of the commissioner but it is not effective unless (1) the plaintiff, who may be the commissioner in a suit, action or proceeding instituted by him or her, forthwith sends notice of the service and a copy of the process by registered or certified mail to the defendant or respondent at the last address on file with the commissioner, and (2) the plaintiff’s affidavit of compliance with this section is filed in the case on or before the 				 return day of the process, if any, or within such further time as the court allows.

CHAPTER 2. Licensing of Agents and Broker-Dealers [25210 - 25221]  ( Chapter 2 added by Stats. 1968, Ch. 88. )

25210.
  (a) Unless exempted under the provisions of Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 25200) of this part, no broker-dealer shall effect any transaction in, or induce or attempt to induce the purchase or sale of, any security in this state unless the broker-dealer has first applied for and secured from the commissioner a certificate, then in effect, authorizing that person to act in that capacity.
(b) No person shall, on behalf of a broker-dealer licensed pursuant to Section 25211, or on behalf of an issuer, effect any transaction in, or induce or attempt to induce the purchase or sale of, any security in this state unless that broker-dealer and agent have complied with any rules as the commissioner may adopt for the qualification and employment of those agents.
(c) The commissioner shall, consistent with Section 25213, review the disciplinary histories of agents upon the filing of notice of (1) the employment or transfer of an agent for a broker-dealer, (2) an amendment to the information filed by the agent at the time of employment or transfer, and (3) the termination of employment of the agent from the broker-dealer.

(1) Such information as is necessary to identify the broker-dealer and its offices in this state, and the location of its records and principal office.
(2) Such information as is necessary to establish that the broker-dealer meets the requirements for licensure by notification under this subdivision.
(3) The consent to service of process specified in Section 25240.

(c)  Unless a proceeding has been instituted under Section 25212, a certificate under subdivision (b) shall become effective on the third business day after the application is filed with the commissioner or upon the day the certificate is issued, whichever first occurs. However, the commissioner may by order delay effectiveness for a period not exceeding 15 business days (or for an additional period with the consent of the applicant) if the commissioner believes that the delay is necessary in the public interest to determine if a proceeding should be instituted under Section 25212. The commissioner may by rule or order waive that provision of subdivision (b) which precludes application thereunder by a person who has had a 						certificate denied or revoked under this law or any predecessor statute if the commissioner finds the waiver to be in the public interest. The commissioner, after appropriate notice and opportunity for hearing in accordance with the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 11500) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code), may by rule or order disqualify a self-regulatory organization specified in subdivision (b) from the provisions thereof. The commissioner may by rule establish standards or criteria pursuant to which disqualification may be made and the commissioner may disqualify upon a finding that the self-regulatory organization fails substantially to comply with those standards or criteria. Disqualification by the commissioner shall not affect a certificate which has become effective pursuant to this subdivision before the effective 						date of that rule or order of disqualification but each person licensed pursuant to subdivision (b) upon the basis of membership in that organization shall, within 90 days after the effective date of that rule or order, or such additional time as the commissioner may allow, file with the commissioner a complete and current application in the form required pursuant to subdivision (a). If a broker-dealer licensed pursuant to subdivision (b) ceases to meet the qualifications for licensing pursuant to that subdivision, they shall, within 10 days after that event, file with the commissioner a complete and current application in the form required pursuant to subdivision (a).
(d) An application for a certificate as a broker-dealer, with respect to a broker-dealer to be formed or organized, may be made by a licensed broker-dealer to which the 						broker-dealer to be formed or organized is to be the successor. The application shall contain such information in such detail relating to the applicant and to the successor and any person associated with the applicant or the successor as the commissioner may by rule require. The application shall become effective and the successor may transact business as a broker-dealer 30 days after the receipt of the application by the commissioner or within such shorter period of time as the commissioner may determine, unless an order has been entered under Section 25212 denying a certificate to the successor or a proceeding looking toward an order has been instituted under that section. The certificate shall terminate on the 45th day after the effective date thereof, unless prior thereto the successor shall, in accordance with such rules as the commissioner may prescribe, adopt the application as its own and 						file the consent to service of process specified in Section 25240.
(Amended by Stats. 2022, Ch. 617, Sec. 130. (SB 1202) Effective January 1, 2023.)

(Amended by Stats. 2002, Ch. 772, Sec. 4. Effective January 1, 2003.)

  (a) It is unlawful for any person, as to whom an order suspending or barring employment or control is in effect pursuant to Section 25213 or 25213.3, willfully to become or to be employed by any broker-dealer or investment adviser, contrary to the terms of that order, without the consent of the commissioner; and it is unlawful for any broker-dealer to permit a person as to whom an order is in effect pursuant to Section 25213, 25213.3, or 25232.1 to become or to remain a person employed by the broker-dealer, contrary to the terms of that order, without the consent of the commissioner, if the broker-dealer knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known, of the order.
(b) Any person as to whom an order suspending or barring employment or control is issued pursuant to Section 25213 or 25213.3 may petition the commissioner for reinstatement or reduction of penalty, or for modification of the order, as provided in and subject to the provisions of Section 11522 of the Government Code.

  No order may be entered under Section 25212, 25213, 25213.3, or 25252 except after notice to any person affected thereby (and, in the case of an agent, to his or her employer or prospective employer if known to the commissioner) of the intention of the commissioner to enter that order and of the reasons therefor and that upon receipt of a request the matter will be set down for hearing to commence within 15 business days after that receipt unless the person affected consents to a later date.

(b) No broker-dealer or agent shall effect any transaction in, or induce or attempt to induce the purchase or sale of, any security in this state in connection with which such broker-dealer or agent engages in any fraudulent, deceptive or manipulative act or practice or makes any fictitious quotation.

(c) No broker-dealer or agent shall effect any transaction in, or induce or attempt to induce the purchase or sale of, any security in this state in contravention of such rules as the commissioner may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors to provide safeguards with respect to the financial responsibility of broker-dealers. Subject to the limitations of Section 15(h) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, those rules may require a minimum capital for broker-dealers or prescribe a ratio between net capital and aggregate indebtedness or both and a fidelity bond.
(d) No broker-dealer or agent shall effect or attempt to effect in this state, in contravention of such rules as the commissioner may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors, (1) any transaction in connection with any security whereby any party to such transaction acquires any put, call, straddle, or other option or privilege (A) of buying or selling the security, (B) on any security, certificate of deposit, or group or index of securities (including any interest therein or based on the market value thereof), (C) entered into on a national securities exchange relating to foreign currency, or (2) any transaction in connection with any security with relation to which the broker-dealer or agent has, directly or indirectly, any interest in any such put, call, straddle, option, or privilege, or (3) any transaction in any security for the account of any person who the broker-dealer or agent has reason to believe has, and who actually has, directly or indirectly, any interest in any such put, call, straddle, option, or privilege with relation to such security.

The bond, unless previously canceled, shall cover for the entire period that the qualification is in effect. If a deposit in lieu of a bond is made pursuant to Article 7 (commencing with Section 995.710) of Chapter 2 of Title 14 of Part 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the deposit may include an appropriate deposit of securities. No suit may be maintained to enforce any liability on the bond unless brought within two years after the contract of sale or other act upon which the suit is based.

25217.
  (a) A broker-dealer licensed under this chapter shall not effect any transaction in, or induce or attempt to induce the purchase or sale of, any security in this state unless that broker-dealer and all agents employed by that broker-dealer meet specified and appropriate standards with respect to training, experience, supervision, terms of employment, and other qualifications as the commissioner finds necessary or desirable. The commissioner may establish those standards by rules, which may: (1) appropriately classify broker-dealers and agents (taking into account relevant matters, including types of business done and nature of securities sold); (2) specify that all or any portion of those standards shall be applicable to any class; (3) require persons in any class to pass examinations 				 prescribed in accordance with those rules; and (4) provide that persons in any class, other than a broker-dealer and partners, officers and supervisory employees (which term may be defined by the commissioner’s rules and as so defined shall include branch managers of broker-dealers) of broker-dealers, may be qualified solely on the basis of compliance with such specified standards of training and such other qualifications as the commissioner finds appropriate.
(b) In addition to the fees imposed by Section 25608, the commissioner may prescribe by rule reasonable fees and charges to defray the cost of any examination administered by the commissioner or under the commissioner’s direction. The commissioner may cooperate with national securities associations and national securities exchanges and with the Securities and Exchange Commission in administering examinations and may require broker-dealers and agents to pass examinations administered by or 				 on behalf of any association or exchange or by the Securities and Exchange Commission and to pay to that association or exchange or that commission reasonable fees or charges to defray the costs incurred by that association or exchange or commission in administering the examinations.
(Amended by Stats. 2019, Ch. 143, Sec. 48. (SB 251) Effective January 1, 2020.)
25218.
  No broker-dealer licensed under this chapter shall effect any transaction in, or induce or attempt to induce the purchase or sale of, any security in this state in contravention of such rules as the commissioner may prescribe designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to provide safeguards against unreasonable profits or unreasonable rates of commissions or other charges, and in general to protect investors and the public interest, and to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market.
(Amended by Stats. 1979, Ch. 665.)
25219.
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this division, if in his or her opinion the public interest and the protection of investors so require, the commissioner is authorized summarily to suspend all over-the-counter trading in this state by broker-dealers and agents in any security or summarily to suspend all trading on a national securities exchange located in this state in any security (provided, in the case of trading on that exchange, that the security is not listed on any national securities exchange located outside this state on which trading has not been suspended) for a period not exceeding 90 days, and for successive periods of 90 days. No broker-dealer or agent shall effect any transaction (other than an unsolicited brokerage transaction effected on a national securities exchange located outside this 				 state) in, or induce or attempt to induce the purchase or sale of, any security in this state in which trading is in any manner suspended under this section, except in performance of a contract previously entered into.
(Amended by Stats. 2009, Ch. 131, Sec. 13. (AB 991) Effective January 1, 2010.)
25220.
  At any time after the issuance of an order under Section 25219, any interested person (including, but not limited to, the issuer of the security and any broker-dealer who has been making a market in the security) may in writing request that the suspension of trading be rescinded. Upon the receipt of such a written request, the matter shall be set down for hearing to commence within 15 business days after such receipt unless the person making the request consents to a later date. After such hearing, which shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 11500) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code, and in connection with which the commissioner shall have all of the powers granted thereunder, the commissioner may order such suspension to be continued until modified or rescinded by further order of the commissioner if he finds that trading in the security will be unfair, unjust, or inequitable to investors or will tend to work a fraud upon the purchasers or sellers of such security. Otherwise, he shall rescind the suspension of trading and no further orders may be entered under Section 25219 with respect to the same security in the absence of changed circumstances justifying such order.
(Amended by Stats. 1973, Ch. 390.)

(d) Whenever the commissioner has taken possession of any broker-dealer or investment adviser, the broker-dealer or investment adviser, within 10 days after the taking, may apply to the superior court to enjoin further proceedings in any California county or city and county in which the California office or offices of the broker-dealer or investment adviser is located.

During that time, the rights of a broker-dealer or investment adviser and of all persons with respect thereto, subject to the other provisions of this section, are the same as if the commissioner had taken possession of the property, business, and assets. A conservator, while in possession of the property, business, and assets of a broker-dealer or investment adviser shall have all the rights, powers, and privileges of the broker-dealer or investment adviser, its officers and directors or partners. All expenses of the conservatorship shall be paid out of the assets of the broker-dealer or investment adviser and shall be a lien thereon which shall be prior to any other lien.

(c) After the exhaustion of the review procedures provided in accordance with the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 11500) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code, the commissioner may apply to the appropriate superior court for a judgment in the amount of the ancillary relief and costs awarded in a final decision and order compelling the respondent, or the named or cited person, to comply with the final decision of the commissioner brought under this division.

25500.
  Any person who willfully participates in any act or transaction in violation of Section 25400 shall be liable to any other person who purchases or sells any security at a price which was affected by such act or transaction for the damages sustained by the latter as a result of such act or transaction. Such damages shall be the difference between the price at which such other person purchased or sold securities and the market value which such securities would have had at the time of his purchase or sale in the absence of such act or transaction, plus interest at the legal rate.
(Repealed and added by Stats. 1968, Ch. 88.)
25501.
  Any person who violates Section 25401 shall be liable to the person who purchases a security from, or sells a security to, that person, who may sue either for rescission or for damages (if the plaintiff or the defendant, as the case may be, no longer owns the security), unless the defendant proves that the plaintiff knew the facts concerning the untruth or omission or that the defendant exercised reasonable care and did not know (or if the defendant had exercised reasonable care, would not have known) of the untruth or omission. Upon rescission, a purchaser may recover the consideration paid for the security, plus interest at the legal rate, less the amount of any income received on the security, upon tender of the security. Upon rescission, a seller may recover the security, upon tender of the consideration 				 paid for the security plus interest at the legal rate, less the amount of any income received by the defendant on the security. Damages recoverable under this section by a purchaser shall be an amount equal to the difference between (a) the price at which the security was bought plus interest at the legal rate from the date of purchase and (b) the value of the security at the time it was disposed of by the plaintiff plus the amount of any income received on the security by the plaintiff. Damages recoverable under this section by a seller shall be an amount equal to the difference between (1) the value of the security at the time of the filing of the complaint plus the amount of any income received by the defendant on the security and (2) the price at which the security was sold plus interest at the legal rate from the date of sale. Any tender specified in this section may be made at any time before entry of judgment. In addition to the relief described above, the court shall award reasonable attorney’s fees 				 and costs to a prevailing purchaser or seller who succeeds in establishing a right to the relief provided by this section.

(Repealed and added by Stats. 1968, Ch. 88.)
25502.5.
  (a) Any person other than the issuer who violates Section 25402 shall be liable to the issuer of the security purchased or sold in violation of Section 25402 for damages in an amount up to three times the difference between the price at which the security was purchased or sold and the market value which the security would have had at the time of the purchase or sale if the information known to the defendant had been publicly disseminated prior to that time and a reasonable time had elapsed for the market to absorb the information and shall be liable to the issuer of the security or to a person who institutes an action under this section in the right of the issuer of the security for reasonable costs and attorney’s fees.

If a proceeding has been commenced by the Securities and Exchange Commission but has not been finally resolved, the court shall delay entering a judgment for the plaintiff under this section until that proceeding is resolved.
(c) If any shareholder of an issuer alleges to the board that there has been a violation of this section, the board shall be required to consider the allegation in good faith, and if the allegation involves misconduct by any director, that director shall not be entitled to vote on any matter involving the allegation.

(d) This section shall only apply to issuers who have total assets in excess of one million dollars ($1,000,000) and have a class of equity security held of record by 500 or more persons.

25503.
  Any person who violates Section 25110, 25130, or 25133, or a condition of qualification under Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 25110) of this part, imposed pursuant to Section 25141, or an order suspending trading issued pursuant to Section 25219, shall be liable to any person acquiring from them the security sold in violation of that section, who may sue to recover the consideration they paid for that security with interest thereon at the legal rate, and reasonable attorney’s fees, less the amount of any income received therefrom, upon the tender of that security, or for damages, if they no longer own the security, or if the consideration given for the security is not capable of being returned. Damages, if the plaintiff no longer owns the security, shall be equal to the difference between (a) the purchase 				 price plus interest at the legal rate from the date of purchase, plus reasonable attorney’s fees, and (b) the value of the security at the time it was disposed of by the plaintiff plus the amount of any income received therefrom by the plaintiff.
Damages, if the consideration given for the security is not capable of being returned, shall be equal to the value of that consideration plus interest at the legal rate from the date of purchase, provided the security is tendered, plus reasonable attorney’s fees; and if the plaintiff no longer owns the security, damages in that case shall be equal to the difference between (a) the value of the consideration given for the security plus interest at the legal rate from the date of purchase, plus reasonable attorney’s fees; and (b) the value of the security at the time it was disposed of by the plaintiff plus the amount of any income received therefrom by the plaintiff.

Any person on whose behalf an offering is made and any underwriter of the offering, whether on a best efforts or a firm commitment basis, shall be jointly and severally liable under this section, but in no event shall any underwriter (unless that underwriter shall have knowingly received from the issuer for acting as an underwriter some benefit, directly or indirectly, in which all other underwriters similarly situated did not share in proportion to their respective interest in the underwriting) be liable in any suit or suits 				 authorized under this section for damages in excess of the total price at which the securities underwritten by them and distributed to the public were offered to the public. Any tender specified in this section may be made at any time before entry of judgment. No person shall be liable under this section for violation of Section 25110, 25120 or 25130 if the sale of the security is qualified prior to the payment or receipt of any part of the consideration for the security sold, even though an offer to sell or a contract of sale may have been made or entered into without qualification.

Upon a proper showing, a permanent or preliminary injunction, restraining order, or writ of mandate shall be granted and a receiver, monitor, conservator, or other designated fiduciary or officer of the court may be appointed for the defendant or the defendant’s assets, or any other 				 ancillary relief may be granted as appropriate.
A receiver, monitor, conservator, or other designated fiduciary or officer of the court appointed by the superior court pursuant to this section may, with the approval of the court, exercise any or all of the powers of the defendant’s officers, directors, partners, trustees or persons who exercise similar powers and perform similar duties, including the filing of a petition for bankruptcy. No action at law or in equity may be maintained by any party against the commissioner, or a receiver, monitor, conservator, or other designated fiduciary or officer of the court, by reason of their exercising these powers or performing these duties pursuant to the order of, or with the approval of, the superior court.
(b) If the commissioner determines it is in the public interest, the commissioner may include in any action authorized by subdivision (a) a claim for 				 ancillary relief, including but not limited to, a claim for restitution or disgorgement or damages on behalf of the persons injured by the act or practice constituting the subject matter of the action, and the court shall have jurisdiction to award additional relief.
(c) In any case in which a defendant is ordered by the court to pay restitution to a victim, the court may in its order require the payment as a money judgment, which shall be enforceable by a victim as if the restitution order were a separate civil judgment, and enforceable in the same manner as is provided for the enforcement of any other money judgment. Any order issued under this subdivision shall contain provisions that are designed to achieve a fair and orderly satisfaction of the judgment.

  In any proceeding under Section 25530, the court may prohibit, conditionally or unconditionally, and permanently or for such period of time as it shall determine, any person who violated Section 25401 from acting as an officer or director of any issuer that has securities qualified pursuant to Section 25110, or that has securities or a transaction exempt from qualification pursuant to Section 25100, 25102, or 25103, if the person’s conduct demonstrates unfitness to serve as an officer or director of the issuer.
(Added by Stats. 2007, Ch. 101, Sec. 6. Effective January 1, 2008.)
25531.
  (a) The commissioner in his discretion (1) may make such public or private investigations within or outside of this state as he deems necessary to determine whether any person has violated or is about to violate any provision of this law or any rule or order hereunder or to aid in the enforcement of this law or in the prescribing of rules and forms hereunder, and (2) may publish information concerning any violation of this law or any rule or order hereunder.
(b) In making any investigation authorized by subdivision (a) of this section, the commissioner may, for a reasonable time not exceeding 30 days, take possession of the books, records, accounts and other papers pertaining to the business of any broker-dealer or investment adviser and place a keeper in exclusive charge of them in the place where they are usually kept. During such possession no person shall remove or attempt to remove any of the books, records, accounts, or other papers except pursuant to a court order or with the consent of the commissioner; but the directors, officers, partners, and employees of the broker-dealer or investment adviser may examine them, and employees shall be permitted to make entries therein reflecting current transactions.
(c) For the purpose of any investigation or proceeding under this law, the commissioner or any officer designated by him may administer oaths and affirmations, subpoena witnesses, compel their attendance, take evidence, and require the production of any books, papers, correspondence, memoranda, agreements, or other documents or records which the commissioner deems relevant or material to the inquiry.
(d) In case of contumacy by, or refusal to obey a subpoena issued to, any person, the superior court, upon application by the commissioner, may issue to the person an order requiring him to appear before the commissioner, or the officer designated by him, there to produce documentary evidence, if so ordered, or to give evidence touching the matter under investigation or in question. Failure to obey the order of the court may be punished by the court as a contempt.
(e) No person is excused from attending and testifying or from producing any document or record before the commissioner, or in obedience to the subpoena of the commissioner or any officer designated by him, or in any proceeding instituted by the commissioner, on the ground that the testimony or evidence (documentary or otherwise) required of him may tend to incriminate him or subject him to a penalty or forfeiture; but no individual may be prosecuted or subjected to any penalty or forfeiture for or on account of any transaction, matter, or thing concerning which he is compelled, after validly claiming his privilege against self-incrimination, to testify or produce evidence (documentary or otherwise), except that the individual testifying is not exempt from prosecution and punishment for perjury or contempt committed in testifying.

The licensee shall be given a preliminary estimate of the fee before the commissioner commences an examination, audit, or investigation.

DIVISION 5. FRANCHISE INVESTMENT LAW [31000 - 31516]  ( Division 5 added by Stats. 1970, Ch. 1400. )

PART 1. DEFINITIONS [31000 - 31019]  ( Part 1 added by Stats. 1970, Ch. 1400. )

31000.
  This division may be known as the “Franchise Investment Law.” References in this division to “this law” refer to the applicable provisions of this division.
(Added by Stats. 1970, Ch. 1400.)
31001.
  The Legislature hereby finds and declares that the widespread sale of franchises is a relatively new form of business which has created numerous problems both from an investment and a business point of view in the State of California. Prior to the enactment of this division, the sale of franchises was regulated only to the limited extent to which the Corporate Securities Law of 1968 applied to those transactions. California franchisees have suffered substantial losses where the franchisor or his or her representative has not provided full and complete information regarding the franchisor-franchisee relationship, the details of the contract between franchisor and franchisee, and the prior business experience of the franchisor.
It is the intent of this law to provide each prospective franchisee with the information necessary to make an intelligent decision regarding franchises being offered. Further, it is the intent of this law to prohibit the sale of franchises where the sale would lead to fraud or a likelihood that the franchisor’s promises would not be fulfilled, and to protect the franchisor and franchisee by providing a better understanding of the relationship between the franchisor and franchisee with regard to their business relationship.
(Amended by Stats. 2004, Ch. 458, Sec. 1. Effective September 10, 2004. Operative January 1, 2005, by Sec. 19 of Ch. 458.)
31001.1.
  (a) To enhance the uniform and efficient administration, and the effective enforcement, of this division, it is the intent of the Legislature that the commissioner shall maintain a risk-based process of reviewing franchise applications as described in this section.
(b) Under the risk-based review process, the commissioner shall focus on reviewing application information posing the most risk to prospective franchisees in accordance with Section 31115, with emphasis on risks associated with the franchisor’s financial condition, the franchisor’s compliance record, and significant deficiencies with the franchisor’s application.
(c) When reviewing franchise filings under this section, the commissioner shall concentrate on helping to prevent misappropriation, mismanagement, and misrepresentation in connection with the offer or sale of any franchise subject to this division.
(d) The commissioner shall consider guidelines, or other information developed by the North American Securities Administrators Association that are in effect, to assist in the implementation of the risk-based review process. The risk-based review procedures implemented by the commissioner shall be considered internal management criteria and guidelines within the meaning of subdivisions (d) and (e) of Section 11340.9 of the Government Code.

  (a) All applications, reports and other papers and documents filed with the commissioner under this law shall be open to public inspection, except that the commissioner may, in his discretion, withhold from public inspection any information the disclosure of which is, in the judgment of the commissioner, not necessary in the public interest or for the protection of investors. The commissioner may publish any information filed with him or obtained by him, if, in the judgment of the commissioner, such action is in the public interest. No provision of this law authorizes the commissioner or any of his assistants, clerks, or deputies to disclose any information withheld from public inspection except among themselves or when necessary or appropriate in a proceeding or investigation under this law or to other federal or state regulatory agencies. No provision of this law either creates or derogates from any privilege which exists at common law or otherwise when documentary or other evidence is sought under a subpoena directed to the commissioner or any of his assistants, clerks, or deputies.
(b) It is unlawful for the commissioner or any of his assistants, clerks, or deputies to use for personal benefit any information which is filed with or obtained by the commissioner and which is not then generally available to the public.

In any judicial proceeding or prosecution, any copy so certified is prima facie evidence of the contents of the document certified.
(Added by Stats. 1970, Ch. 1400.)
31506.
  (a) The commissioner may destroy any applications or orders, together with the files and folders, as useless or obsolete, four years after the date of filing or issuance, with the approval of the Department of General Services; provided that a permanent record shall be maintained of any disciplinary action taken by the commissioner.
(b) Copies on microfilm or in other form which may be retained by the commissioner in his discretion of any records destroyed under this section shall be accepted for all purposes as equivalent to the original when certified by the commissioner.
(Added by Stats. 1970, Ch. 1400.)

  The commissioner in his discretion may honor requests from interested persons for interpretive opinions.
(Added by Stats. 1970, Ch. 1400.)
31511.
  No provision of this law imposing any liability applies to any act done or omitted in good faith in conformity with any rule, form, order, or any written interpretive opinion of the commissioner, or any opinion of the Attorney General, notwithstanding that the rule, form, order, or written interpretive opinion may later be amended or rescinded or be determined by judicial or other authority to be invalid for any reason.
(Added by Stats. 1970, Ch. 1400.)
31512.
  Any condition, stipulation or provision purporting to bind any person acquiring any franchise to waive compliance with any provision of this law or any rule or order hereunder is void.

(b) Reliance by a franchisee on any representations made by the franchisor or its personnel or agents.
(c) Reliance by a franchisee on the franchise disclosure document, including any exhibit thereto.

(Added by Stats. 2022, Ch. 728, Sec. 12. (AB 676) Effective January 1, 2023.)
31513.
  Whenever a person is entitled under this law to a hearing in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 11500) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code, a formal hearing before the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation may be substituted with the consent of such person and of the commissioner for such hearing before an independent hearing officer; and in that case after such hearing before the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation such person shall not be entitled to any further administrative remedy.
(Amended by Stats. 2022, Ch. 452, Sec. 95. (SB 1498) Effective January 1, 2023.)
31514.
  If any provision of this law or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of this law which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this law are declared to be severable.
(Added by Stats. 1970, Ch. 1400.)
31515.
  Prior law exclusively governs all suits, actions, prosecutions or proceedings which are pending or may be initiated on the basis of facts or circumstances occurring before the effective date of this law.
